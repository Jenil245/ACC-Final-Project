It can be used with for loop or while loop. The Java continue statement is used to continue the loop. It continues the current flow of the program and skips the remaining code at the specified condition. In case of an inner loop, it continues the inner loop only. We can use Java continue statement in all types of loops such as for loop, while loop and do-while loop. Syntax: 
jump-statement;  
continue; 
 Java Continue Statement Example ContinueExample.java 
//Java Program to demonstrate the use of continue statement
//inside the for loop.
public class ContinueExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
    //for loop
    for(int i=1;i<=10;i++){
    	if(i==5){
    	    //using continue statement
    		continue;//it will skip the rest statement
    	}
    	System.out.println(i);
    }
}
}

 As you can see in the above output, 5 is not printed on the console. It is because the loop is continued when it reaches to 5. Java Continue Statement with Inner Loop It continues inner loop only if you use the continue statement inside the inner loop. ContinueExample2.java 
//Java Program to illustrate the use of continue statement
//inside an inner loop
public class ContinueExample2 {
public static void main(String[] args) {
            //outer loop
	        for(int i=1;i<=3;i++){  
	                //inner loop
	                for(int j=1;j<=3;j++){  
	                    if(i==2&&j==2){  
	                        //using continue statement inside inner loop
	                        continue;  
	                    }  
	                    System.out.println(i+" "+j);  
	                }  
	        }  
}
}

 Java Continue Statement with Labelled For Loop We can use continue statement with a label. This feature is introduced since JDK 1.5. So, we can continue any loop in Java now whether it is outer loop or inner. Example: ContinueExample3.java 
//Java Program to illustrate the use of continue statement
//with label inside an inner loop to continue outer loop
public class ContinueExample3 {
public static void main(String[] args) {
            aa:
	        for(int i=1;i<=3;i++){  
	                bb:
	                for(int j=1;j<=3;j++){  
	                    if(i==2&&j==2){  
	                        //using continue statement with label
	                        continue aa;  
	                    }  
	                    System.out.println(i+" "+j);  
	                }  
	        }  
}

 Java Continue Statement in while loop ContinueWhileExample.java 
//Java Program to demonstrate the use of continue statement
//inside the while loop.
public class ContinueWhileExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
    //while loop
    int i=1;
    while(i<=10){
        if(i==5){
    	    //using continue statement
            i++;
    		continue;//it will skip the rest statement
    	}
    	System.out.println(i);
        i++;
    }

    int i=1;
