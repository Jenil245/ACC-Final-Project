Java socket programming provides facility to share data between different computing devices. Advantage of Java Networking Sharing resources Centralize software management Do You Know ? How to perform connection-oriented Socket Programming in networking ? How to display the data of any online web page ? How to get the IP address of any host name e.g. www.google.com ? How to perform connection-less socket programming in networking ? The java.net package supports two protocols, TCP: Transmission Control Protocol provides reliable communication between the sender and receiver. TCP is used along with the Internet Protocol referred as TCP/IP. UDP: User Datagram Protocol provides a connection-less protocol service by allowing packet of data to be transferred along two or more nodes Java Networking Terminology The widely used Java networking terminologies are given below: IP Address Protocol Port Number MAC Address Connection-oriented and connection-less protocol Socket 1) IP Address IP address is a unique number assigned to a node of a network e.g. 192.168.0.1 . It is composed of octets that range from 0 to 255. It is a logical address that can be changed. 2) Protocol A protocol is a set of rules basically that is followed for communication. For example: TCP FTP Telnet SMTP POP etc. 3) Port Number The port number is used to uniquely identify different applications. It acts as a communication endpoint between applications. The port number is associated with the IP address for communication between two applications. 4) MAC Address MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier of NIC (Network Interface Controller). A network node can have multiple NIC but each with unique MAC address. For example, an ethernet card may have a MAC address of 00:0d:83::b1:c0:8e. 5) Connection-oriented and connection-less protocol In connection-oriented protocol, acknowledgement is sent by the receiver. So it is reliable but slow. The example of connection-oriented protocol is TCP. But, in connection-less protocol, acknowledgement is not sent by the receiver. So it is not reliable but fast. The example of connection-less protocol is UDP. 6) Socket A socket is an endpoint between two way communications.

A High Level API: It deals with the abstraction of URIs i.e. Universal Resource Identifier, URLs i.e. Universal Resource Locator, and Connections i.e. connections to the resource pointed by URLs. The java.net package provides many classes to deal with networking applications in Java.
