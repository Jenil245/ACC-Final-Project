why main method static static block can we execute program without main method static keyword java used memory management mainly we can apply static keyword variables methods blocks nested classes static keyword belongs class than instance class static can variable also known class variable method also known class method block nested class java static variable you declare any variable static known static variable static variable can used refer common property all objects which unique each object example company name employees college name students etc static variable gets memory only once class area time class loading advantages static variable makes your program memory efficient i e saves memory understanding problem without static variable class student int rollno string name string college its suppose students my college now all instance data members get memory each time when object created all students have its unique rollno name so instance data member good case here college refers common property all objects we make static field get memory only once java static property shared all objects example static variable java program demonstrate use static variable class student int rollno instance variable string name static string college its static variable constructor student int r string n rollno r name n method display values void display system out println rollno name college test class show values objects public class teststaticvariable public static void main string args student s new student karan student s new student aryan we can change college all objects single line code student college bbdit s display s display test now output karan its aryan its program counter without static variable example we have created instance variable named count which incremented constructor since instance variable gets memory time object creation each object have copy instance variable incremented won t reflect other objects so each object have value count variable java program demonstrate use instance variable which get memory each time when we create object class class counter int count get memory each time when instance created counter count incrementing value system out println count public static void main string args creating objects counter c new counter counter c new counter counter c new counter test now output program counter static variable we have mentioned above static variable get memory only once any object changes value static variable retain its value java program illustrate use static variable which shared all objects class counter static int count get memory only once retain its value counter count incrementing value static variable system out println count public static void main string args creating objects counter c new counter counter c new counter counter c new counter test now output java static method you apply static keyword any method known static method static method belongs class rather than object class static method can invoked without need creating instance class static method can access static data member can change value example static method java program demonstrate use static method class student int rollno string name static string college its static method change value static variable static void change college bbdit constructor initialize variable student int r string n rollno r name n method display values void display system out println rollno name college test class create display values object public class teststaticmethod public static void main string args student change calling change method creating objects student s new student karan student s new student aryan student s new student sonoo calling display method s display s display s display test now output karan bbdit aryan bbdit sonoo bbdit another example static method performs normal calculation java program get cube given number using static method class calculate static int cube int x return x x x public static void main string args int result calculate cube system out println result test now output restrictions static method two main restrictions static method static method can use non static data member call non static method directly super cannot used static context class int non static public static void main string args system out println test now output compile time error q why java main method static ans because object required call static method were non static method jvm creates object first call main method lead problem extra memory allocation java static block used initialize static data member executed before main method time classloading example static block class static system out println static block invoked public static void main string args system out println hello main test now output static block invoked hello main q can we execute program without main method ans one ways static block possible till jdk since jdk possible execute java class without main method class static system out println static block invoked system exit test now output static block invoked since jdk above output would error main method found class please define main method public static void main string args javafx application class must extend javafx application application next topicthis keyword java prev next videos join our youtube channel join now feedback
