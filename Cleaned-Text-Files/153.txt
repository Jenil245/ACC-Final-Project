cloud computing virtualization based technology allows us create configure customize applications via internet connection cloud technology includes development platform hard disk software application database what cloud computing term cloud refers network internet technology uses remote servers internet store manage access data online rather than local drives data can anything files images documents audio video more following operations we can do using cloud computing developing new applications services storage back up recovery data hosting blogs websites delivery software demand analysis data streaming videos audios why cloud computing small well large companies follow traditional methods provide infrastructure means any company we need server room basic need companies server room should database server mail server networking firewalls routers modem switches qps query per second means how much queries load handled server configurable system high net speed maintenance engineers establish infrastructure we need spend lots money overcome all problems reduce infrastructure cost cloud computing comes existence characteristics cloud computing characteristics cloud computing given below agility cloud works distributed computing environment shares resources among users works very fast high availability reliability availability servers high more reliable because chances infrastructure failure minimum high scalability cloud offers demand provisioning resources large scale without having engineers peak loads multi sharing help cloud computing multiple users applications can work more efficiently cost reductions sharing common infrastructure device location independence cloud computing enables users access systems using web browser regardless location what device use e g pc mobile phone etc infrastructure off site typically provided third party accessed via internet users can connect from anywhere maintenance maintenance cloud computing applications easier since do need installed each user s computer can accessed from different places so reduces cost also low cost using cloud computing cost reduced because take services cloud computing company need set its own infrastructure pay per usage resources services pay per use mode application programming interfaces apis provided users so can access services cloud using apis pay charges per usage services prerequisite before learning cloud computing you must have basic knowledge computer fundamentals audience our cloud computing designed help beginners professionals problem
