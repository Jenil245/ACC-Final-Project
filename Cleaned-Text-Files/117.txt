jdbc stands java database connectivity jdbc java api connect execute query database part javase java standard edition jdbc api uses jdbc drivers connect database four types jdbc drivers jdbc odbc bridge driver native driver network protocol driver thin driver we have discussed above four drivers next chapter we can use jdbc api access tabular data stored any relational database help jdbc api we can save update delete fetch data from database like open database connectivity odbc provided microsoft current version jdbc stable release since st september based x open sql call level interface java sql package contains classes interfaces jdbc api list popular interfaces jdbc api given below driver interface connection interface statement interface preparedstatement interface callablestatement interface resultset interface resultsetmetadata interface databasemetadata interface rowset interface list popular classes jdbc api given below drivermanager class blob class clob class types class why should we use jdbc before jdbc odbc api database api connect execute query database odbc api uses odbc driver which written c language i e platform dependent unsecured why java has defined its own api jdbc api uses jdbc drivers written java language we can use jdbc api handle database using java program can perform following activities connect database execute queries update statements database retrieve result received from database do you know how connect java application oracle mysql database using jdbc what difference between statement preparedstatement interface how print total numbers tables views database using jdbc how store retrieve images from oracle database using jdbc how store retrieve files from oracle database using jdbc what api api application programming interface document contains description all features product software represents classes interfaces software programs can follow communicate each other api can created applications libraries operating systems etc topics java jdbc tutorial jdbc drivers jdbc tutorial we learn four types jdbc drivers advantages disadvantages steps connect database jdbc tutorial we see five steps connect database java using jdbc connectivity oracle using jdbc jdbc tutorial we connect simple java program oracle database connectivity mysql using jdbc jdbc tutorial we connect simple java program mysql database connectivity access without dsn let s connect java application access database without dsn drivermanager class jdbc tutorial we learn what does drivermanager class what its methods connection interface jdbc tutorial we learn what connection interface what its methods statement interface jdbc tutorial we learn what statement interface what its methods resultset interface jdbc tutorial we learn what resultset interface what its methods moreover we learn how we can make resultset scrollable preparedstatement interface jdbc tutorial we learn what benefit preparedstatement over statement interface we see examples insert update delete records using preparedstatement interface resultsetmetadata interface jdbc tutorial we learn how we can get metadata table databasemetadata interface jdbc tutorial we learn how we can get metadata database storing image oracle let s learn how store image oracle database using jdbc retrieving image from oracle let s see simple example retrieve image from oracle database using jdbc storing file oracle let s see simple example store file oracle database using jdbc retrieving file from oracle let s see simple example retrieve file from oracle database using jdbc callablestatement let s see code call stored procedures functions using callablestatement transaction management using jdbc let s see simple example use transaction management using jdbc batch statement using jdbc let s see code execute batch queries jdbc rowset let s see working new jdbc rowset interface next topicjdbc driver prev next videos join
