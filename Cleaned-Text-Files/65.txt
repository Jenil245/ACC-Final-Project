although data mining very powerful faces many challenges during its execution various challenges could related performance data methods techniques etc process data mining becomes effective when challenges problems correctly recognized adequately resolved incomplete noisy data process extracting useful data from large volumes data data mining data real world heterogeneous incomplete noisy data huge quantities usually inaccurate unreliable problems may occur due data measuring instrument because human errors suppose retail chain collects phone numbers customers who spend more than accounting employees put information system person may make digit mistake when entering phone number which results incorrect data even some customers may willing disclose phone numbers which results incomplete data data could get changed due human system error all consequences noisy incomplete data makes data mining challenging data distribution real worlds data usually stored various platforms distributed computing environment might database individual systems even internet practically quite tough task make all data centralized data repository mainly due organizational technical concerns example various regional offices may have servers store data feasible store all data from all offices central server therefore data mining requires development tools algorithms allow mining distributed data complex data real world data heterogeneous could multimedia data including audio video images complex data spatial data time series so managing various types data extracting useful information tough task most time new technologies new tools methodologies would have refined obtain specific information performance data mining system s performance relies primarily efficiency
