rmi internationalization interview questions next prev java reflection api java reflection process examining modifying run time behavior class run time java lang class class provides many methods can used get metadata examine change run time behavior class java lang java lang reflect packages provide classes java reflection where used reflection api mainly used ide integrated development environment e g eclipse myeclipse netbeans etc debugger test tools etc do you know how many ways can we get instance class class how create javap tool how create appletviewer tool how access private method from outside class java lang class class java lang class class performs mainly two tasks provides methods get metadata class run time provides methods examine change run time behavior class commonly used methods class class method description public string getname returns class name public static class forname string classname throws classnotfoundexception loads class returns reference class class public object newinstance throws instantiationexception illegalaccessexception creates new instance public boolean isinterface checks interface public boolean isarray checks array public boolean isprimitive checks primitive public class getsuperclass returns superclass class reference public field getdeclaredfields throws securityexception returns total number fields class public method getdeclaredmethods throws securityexception returns total number methods class public constructor getdeclaredconstructors throws securityexception returns total number constructors class public method getdeclaredmethod string name class parametertypes throws nosuchmethodexception securityexception returns method class instance how get object class class ways get instance class class follows forname method class class getclass method object class class syntax forname method class class used load class dynamically returns instance class class should used you know fully qualified name class cannot used primitive types let s see simple example forname method filename test java class simple public class test public static void main string args throws exception class c class forname simple system out println c getname output simple getclass method object class returns instance class class should used you know type moreover can used primitives filename test java class simple class test void printname object obj class c obj getclass system out println c getname public static void main string args simple s new simple test t new test t printname s output simple class syntax type available instance possible obtain class appending class name type can used primitive data types also filename test java class test public static void main string args class c boolean class system out println c getname class c test class system out println c getname output boolean test determining class object following methods class class used determine class object public boolean isinterface determines specified class object represents interface type public boolean isarray determines class object represents array class public boolean isprimitive determines specified class object represents primitive type let s see simple example reflection api determine object type filename test java class simple interface my class test public static void main string args try class c class forname simple system out println c isinterface class c class forname my system out println c isinterface catch exception e system out println e output false true pros cons reflection java reflection should always used caution while reflection provides lot advantages has some disadvantages too let s discuss advantages first pros inspection interfaces classes methods fields during runtime possible using reflection even without using names during compile time also possible call methods instantiate clear set value fields using reflection helps creation visual development environments class browsers which provides aid developers write correct code cons using reflection one can break principles encapsulation possible access private methods fields class using reflection thus reflection may leak important data outside world which dangerous example one access private members class sets null value other user same class can get nullreferenceexception behaviour expected another demerit overhead performance since types reflection resolved dynamically jvm java virtual machine optimization cannot take place therefore operations performed reflections usually slow conclusion because above mentioned cons generally advisable avoid using reflection advanced feature should only used programmers developers who have good knowledge basics language always remember whenever reflection used security application compromised next topics reflection api tutorial newinstance method understanding javap tool creating javap tool creating appletviewer tool call private method from another
