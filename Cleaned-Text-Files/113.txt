tutorial interview questions spring interview next spring boot tutorial spring boot tutorial provides basic advanced concepts spring framework our spring boot tutorial designed beginners professionals both spring boot spring module provides rad rapid application development feature spring framework our spring boot tutorial includes all topics spring boot features project maven project starter project wizard spring initializr cli applications annotations dependency management properties starters actuator jpa jdbc etc what spring boot spring boot project built top spring framework provides easier faster way set up configure run both simple web based applications spring module provides rad rapid application development feature spring framework used create stand alone spring based application you can just run because needs minimal spring configuration short spring boot combination spring framework embedded servers spring boot requirement xml configuration deployment descriptor uses convention over configuration software design paradigm means decreases effort developer we can use spring sts ide spring initializr develop spring boot java applications why should we use spring boot framework we should use spring boot framework because dependency injection approach used spring boot contains powerful database transaction management capabilities simplifies integration other java frameworks like jpa hibernate orm struts etc reduces cost development time application along spring boot framework many other spring sister projects help build applications addressing modern business needs following spring sister projects follows spring data simplifies data access from relational nosql databases spring batch provides powerful batch processing spring security security framework provides robust security applications spring social supports integration social networking like linkedin spring integration implementation enterprise integration patterns facilitates integration other enterprise applications using lightweight messaging declarative adapters advantages spring boot creates stand alone spring applications can started using java jar tests web applications easily help different embedded http servers tomcat jetty etc we don t need deploy war files provides opinionated starter poms simplify our maven configuration provides production ready features metrics health checks externalized configuration requirement xml configuration offers cli tool developing testing spring boot application offers number plug ins also minimizes writing multiple boilerplate codes code has included many places little alteration xml configuration annotations increases productivity reduces development time limitations spring boot spring boot can use dependencies going used application dependencies increase size application goals spring boot main goal spring boot reduce development unit test integration test time provides opinionated development approach avoids defining more annotation configuration avoids writing lots import statements avoids xml configuration providing avoiding above points spring boot framework reduces development time developer effort increases productivity prerequisite spring boot create spring boot application following prerequisites tutorial we use spring tool suite sts ide java maven spring framework build snapshot ide spring tool suite recommended spring boot features web development springapplication application events listeners admin features externalized configuration properties files yaml support type safe configuration logging security web development well suited spring module web application development we can easily create self contained http application uses embedded servers like tomcat jetty undertow we can use spring boot starter web module start run application quickly springapplication springapplication class provides convenient way bootstrap spring application can started from main method we can call application just calling static run method public static void main string args springapplication run classname class args application events listeners spring boot uses events handle variety tasks allows us create factories file used add listeners we can refer using applicationlistener key always create factories file meta inf folder like meta inf spring factories admin support spring boot provides facility enable admin related features application used access manage applications remotely we can enable spring boot application using spring application admin enabled property externalized configuration spring boot allows us externalize our configuration so we can work same application different environments application uses yaml files externalize configuration properties files spring boot provides rich set application properties so we can use properties file our project properties file used set properties like server port many others helps organize application properties yaml support provides convenient way specifying hierarchical configuration superset json springapplication class automatically supports yaml alternative properties file type safe configuration strong type safe configuration provided govern validate configuration application application configuration always crucial task which should type safe we can also use annotation provided library logging spring boot uses common logging all internal logging logging dependencies managed default we should change logging dependencies customization needed security spring boot applications spring bases web applications so secure default basic authentication all http endpoints rich set endpoints available develop secure spring boot application prerequisite before learning
