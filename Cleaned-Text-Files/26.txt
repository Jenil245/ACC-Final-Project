machine learning interview next machine learning tutorial machine learning tutorial provides basic advanced concepts machine learning our machine learning tutorial designed students working professionals machine learning growing technology which enables computers learn automatically from past data machine learning uses various algorithms building mathematical models making predictions using historical data information currently being used various tasks image recognition speech recognition email filtering facebook auto tagging recommender system many more machine learning tutorial gives you introduction machine learning along wide range machine learning techniques supervised unsupervised reinforcement learning you learn about regression classification models clustering methods hidden markov models various sequential models what machine learning real world we surrounded humans who can learn everything from experiences learning capability we have computers machines which work our instructions can machine also learn from experiences past data like human does so here comes role machine learning machine learning said subset artificial intelligence mainly concerned development algorithms which allow computer learn from data past experiences own term machine learning first introduced arthur samuel we can define summarized way machine learning enables machine automatically learn from data improve performance from experiences predict things without being explicitly programmed help sample historical data which known training data machine learning algorithms build mathematical model helps making predictions decisions without being explicitly programmed machine learning brings computer science statistics together creating predictive models machine learning constructs uses algorithms learn from historical data more we provide information higher performance machine has ability learn can improve its performance gaining more data how does machine learning work machine learning system learns from historical data builds prediction models whenever receives new data predicts output accuracy predicted output depends upon amount data huge amount data helps build better model which predicts output more accurately suppose we have complex problem where we need perform some predictions so instead writing code we just need feed data generic algorithms help algorithms machine builds logic per data predict output machine learning has changed our way thinking about problem below block diagram explains working machine learning algorithm features machine learning machine learning uses data detect various patterns given dataset can learn from past data improve automatically data driven technology machine learning much similar data mining also deals huge amount data need machine learning need machine learning increasing day day reason behind need machine learning capable doing tasks too complex person implement directly human we have some limitations we cannot access huge amount data manually so we need some computer systems here comes machine learning make things easy us we can train machine learning algorithms providing them huge amount data let them explore data construct models predict required output automatically performance machine learning algorithm depends amount data can determined cost function help machine learning we can save both time money importance machine learning can easily understood its uses cases currently machine learning used self driving cars cyber fraud detection face recognition friend suggestion facebook etc various top companies netflix amazon have build machine learning models using vast amount data analyze user interest recommend product accordingly following some key points which show importance machine learning rapid increment production data solving complex problems which difficult human decision making various sector including finance finding hidden patterns extracting useful information from data classification machine learning broad level machine learning can classified three types supervised learning unsupervised learning reinforcement learning supervised learning supervised learning type machine learning method which we provide sample labeled data machine learning system order train basis predicts output system creates model using labeled data understand datasets learn about each data once training processing done we test model providing sample data check whether predicting exact output goal supervised learning map input data output data supervised learning based supervision same when student learns things supervision teacher example supervised learning spam filtering supervised learning can grouped further two categories algorithms classification regression unsupervised learning unsupervised learning learning method which machine learns without any supervision training provided machine set data has been labeled classified categorized algorithm needs act data without any supervision goal unsupervised learning restructure input data new features group objects similar patterns unsupervised learning we don t have predetermined result machine tries find useful insights from huge amount data can further classifieds two categories algorithms clustering association reinforcement learning reinforcement learning feedback based learning method which learning agent gets reward each right action gets penalty each wrong action agent learns automatically feedbacks improves its performance reinforcement learning agent interacts environment explores goal agent get most reward points hence improves its performance robotic dog which automatically learns movement his arms example reinforcement learning note we learn about above types machine learning detail later chapters history machine learning before some years about years machine learning science fiction today part our daily life machine learning making our day day life easy from self driving cars amazon virtual assistant alexa however idea behind machine learning so old has long history below some milestones given which have occurred history machine learning early history machine learning pre charles babbage father computer conceived device could programmed punch cards however machine never built all modern computers rely its logical structure alan turing gave theory how machine can determine execute set instructions era stored program computers first manually operated computer eniac invented which first electronic general purpose computer after stored program computer edsac edvac were invented human neural network modeled electrical circuit scientists started applying idea work analyzed how human neurons might work computer machinery intelligence alan turing published seminal paper computer machinery intelligence topic artificial intelligence his paper he asked can machines think machine intelligence games arthur samuel who pioneer machine learning created program helped ibm computer play checkers game performed better more played term machine learning first coined arthur samuel first ai winter duration tough time ai ml researchers duration called ai winter duration failure machine translation occurred people had reduced interest from ai which led reduced funding government researches machine learning from theory reality first neural network applied real world problem remove echoes over phone lines using adaptive filter terry sejnowski charles rosenberg invented neural network nettalk which able teach itself how correctly pronounce words one week ibm s deep blue intelligent computer won chess game against chess expert garry kasparov became first computer which had beaten human chess expert machine learning st century year computer scientist geoffrey hinton has given new name neural net research deep learning nowadays has become one most trending technologies google created deep neural network which learned recognize image humans cats youtube videos chabot eugen goostman cleared turing test first chabot who convinced human judges machine deepface deep neural network created facebook claimed could recognize person same precision human can do alphago beat world s number second player lee sedol go game beat number one player game ke jie alphabet s jigsaw team built intelligent system able learn online trolling used read millions comments different websites learn stop online trolling machine learning present now machine learning has got great advancement its research present everywhere around us self driving cars amazon alexa catboats recommender system many more includes supervised unsupervised reinforcement learning clustering classification decision tree svm algorithms etc modern machine learning models can used making various predictions including weather prediction disease prediction stock market analysis etc prerequisites before learning machine learning you must have basic
