tutorial jsp technology used create web application just like servlet technology can thought extension servlet because provides more functionality than servlet expression language jstl etc jsp page consists html tags jsp tags jsp pages easier maintain than servlet because we can separate designing development provides some additional features expression language custom tags etc advantages jsp over servlet many advantages jsp over servlet follows extension servlet jsp technology extension servlet technology we can use all features servlet jsp addition we can use implicit objects predefined tags expression language custom tags jsp makes jsp development easy easy maintain jsp can easily managed because we can easily separate our business logic presentation logic servlet technology we mix our business logic presentation logic fast development need recompile redeploy jsp page modified we don t need recompile redeploy project servlet code needs updated recompiled we have change look feel application less code than servlet jsp we can use many tags action tags jstl custom tags etc reduces code moreover we can use el implicit objects etc lifecycle jsp page jsp pages follow phases translation jsp page compilation jsp page classloading classloader loads class file instantiation object generated servlet created initialization container invokes jspinit method request processing container invokes jspservice method destroy container invokes jspdestroy method note jspinit jspservice jspdestroy life cycle methods jsp depicted above diagram jsp page translated servlet help jsp translator jsp translator part web server which responsible translating jsp page servlet after servlet page compiled compiler gets converted class file moreover all processes happen servlet performed jsp later like initialization committing response browser destroy creating simple jsp page create first jsp page write some html code given below save jsp extension we have saved file index jsp put folder paste folder web apps directory apache tomcat run jsp page index jsp let s see simple example jsp where we using scriptlet tag put java code jsp page we learn scriptlet tag later html body out print body html print browser how run simple jsp page follow following steps execute jsp page start server put jsp file folder deploy server visit browser url http localhost portno contextroot jspfile example http localhost myapplication index jsp do i need follow directory structure run simple jsp need directory structure you don t have class files tld files example put jsp files folder directly deploy folder running fine however you using bean class servlet tld file directory structure required directory structure jsp directory structure jsp page same servlet we contain jsp page outside web inf folder any directory jsp index jsp tutorial life cycle jsp jsp api jsp eclipse jsp scripting elements jsp scriptlet tag jsp expression tag jsp declaration tag implicit objects jsp out jsp request
