what iteration data structure ds mcq data structure mcq advanced ds mcq next data structures tutorial data structures ds tutorial provides basic advanced concepts data structure our data structure tutorial designed beginners professionals data structure way store organize data so can used efficiently our data structure tutorial includes all topics data structure array pointer structure linked list stack queue graph searching sorting programs etc what data structure data structure name indicates itself organizing data memory many ways organizing data memory we have already seen one data structures i e array c language array collection memory elements which data stored sequentially i e one after another other words we can say array stores elements continuous manner organization data done help array data structures also other ways organize data memory let s see different types data structures data structure any programming language like c c java etc set algorithms we can use any programming language structure data memory structure data memory n number algorithms were proposed all algorithms known abstract data types abstract data types set rules types data structures two types data structures primitive data structure non primitive data structure primitive data structure primitive data structures primitive data types int char float double pointer primitive data structures can hold single value non primitive data structure non primitive data structure divided two types linear data structure non linear data structure linear data structure arrangement data sequential manner known linear data structure data structures used purpose arrays linked list stacks queues data structures one element connected only one another element linear form when one element connected n number elements known non linear data structure best example trees graphs case elements arranged random manner we discuss above data structures brief coming topics now we see common operations we can perform data structures data structures can also classified static data structure type data structure where size allocated compile time therefore maximum size fixed dynamic data structure type data structure where size allocated run time therefore maximum size flexible major operations major common operations can performed data structures searching we can search any element data structure sorting we can sort elements data structure either ascending descending order insertion we can also insert new element data structure updation we can also update element i e we can replace element another element deletion we can also perform delete operation remove element from data structure which data structure data structure way organizing data so can used efficiently here we have used word efficiently which terms both space time example stack adt abstract data type which uses either arrays linked list data structure implementation therefore we conclude we require some data structure implement particular adt adt tells what done data structure tells how done other words we can say adt gives us blueprint while data structure provides implementation part now question arises how can one get know which data structure used particular adt different data structures can implemented particular adt different implementations compared time space example stack adt can implemented both arrays linked list suppose array providing time efficiency while linked list providing space efficiency so one which best suited current user s requirements selected advantages data structures following advantages data structure efficiency choice data structure implementing particular adt proper makes program very efficient terms time space reusability data structure provides reusability means multiple client programs can use data structure abstraction data structure specified adt also provides level abstraction client cannot see internal working data structure so does have worry about implementation part client can only see interface data structures index ds basics ds tutorial ds introduction ds algorithm ds asymptotic analysis ds pointer ds structure ds array
