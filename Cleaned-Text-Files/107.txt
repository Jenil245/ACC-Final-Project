tools next data warehouse tutorial data warehouse relational database management system rdbms construct meet requirement transaction processing systems can loosely described any centralized data repository which can queried business benefits database stores information oriented satisfy decision making requests group decision support technologies targets enabling knowledge worker executive manager analyst make superior higher decisions so data warehousing support architectures tool business executives systematically organize understand use information make strategic decisions data warehouse environment contains extraction transportation loading etl solution online analytical processing olap engine customer analysis tools other applications handle process gathering information delivering business users what data warehouse data warehouse dw relational database designed query analysis rather than transaction processing includes historical data derived from transaction data from single multiple sources data warehouse provides integrated enterprise wide historical data focuses providing support decision makers data modeling analysis data warehouse group data specific entire organization only particular group users used daily operations transaction processing used making decisions data warehouse can viewed data system following attributes database designed investigative tasks using data from various applications supports relatively small number clients relatively long interactions includes current historical data provide historical perspective information its usage read intensive contains few large tables data warehouse subject oriented integrated time variant store information support management s decisions characteristics data warehouse subject oriented data warehouse target modeling analysis data decision makers therefore data warehouses typically provide concise straightforward view around particular subject customer product sales instead global organization s ongoing operations done excluding data useful concerning subject including all data needed users understand subject integrated data warehouse integrates various heterogeneous data sources like rdbms flat files online transaction records requires performing data cleaning integration during data warehousing ensure consistency naming conventions attributes types etc among different data sources time variant historical information kept data warehouse example one can retrieve files from months months months even previous data from data warehouse variations transactions system where often only most current file kept non volatile data warehouse physically separate data storage which transformed from source operational rdbms operational updates data do occur data warehouse i e update insert delete operations performed usually requires only two procedures data accessing initial loading data access data therefore dw does require transaction processing recovery concurrency capabilities which allows substantial speedup data retrieval non volatile defines once entered warehouse data should change history data warehouse idea data warehousing came late s when ibm researchers barry devlin paul murphy established business data warehouse essence data warehousing idea planned support architectural model flow information from operational system decisional support environments concept attempt address various problems associated flow mainly high costs associated absence data warehousing architecture vast amount space required support multiple decision support environments large corporations ordinary various decision support environments operate independently goals data warehousing help reporting well analysis maintain organization s historical information foundation decision making need data warehouse data warehouse needed following reasons business user business users require data warehouse view summarized data from past since people non technical data may presented them elementary form store historical data data warehouse required store time variable data from past input made used various purposes make strategic decisions some strategies may depending upon data data warehouse so data warehouse contributes making strategic decisions data consistency quality bringing data from different sources commonplace user can effectively undertake bring uniformity consistency data high response time data warehouse has ready somewhat unexpected loads types queries which demands significant degree flexibility quick response time benefits data warehouse understand business trends make better forecasting decisions data warehouses designed perform well enormous amounts data structure data warehouses more accessible end users navigate understand query queries would complex many normalized databases could easier build maintain data warehouses data warehousing efficient method manage demand lots information from lots users data warehousing provide capabilities analyze large amount historical data prerequisites before learning about data warehouse you must have fundamental knowledge basic database concepts schema
