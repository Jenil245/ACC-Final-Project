fully encapsulated class java making all data members class private now we can use setter getter methods set get data java bean class example fully encapsulated class advantage encapsulation java providing only setter getter method you can make class read only write only other words you can skip getter setter methods provides you control over data suppose you want set value id which should greater than only you can write logic inside setter method you can write logic store negative numbers setter methods way achieve data hiding java because other class able access data through private data members encapsulate class easy test so better unit testing standard ide s providing facility generate getters setters so easy fast create encapsulated class java simple example encapsulation java let s see simple example encapsulation has only one field its setter getter methods file student java java class which fully encapsulated class has private data member getter setter methods package com javatpoint public class student private data member private string name getter method name public string getname return name setter method name public void setname string name name name file test java java class test encapsulated class package com javatpoint class test public static void main string args creating instance encapsulated class student s new student setting value name member s

class student private data member private string college akg getter method college public string getcollege return college now you can t change value college data member which akg s setcollege kite render compile time error write only class java class which has only setter methods public class student private data member private string college getter method college public void setcollege string college college college now you can t get value college you can only change value college data member system out println s getcollege compile time error because method system out println s college compile time error because college data member private so can t accessed from outside class another example encapsulation java let s see another example encapsulation has only four fields its setter
