which appear however java provides statements can used control flow java code statements called control flow statements one fundamental features java which provides smooth flow program java provides three types control flow statements decision making statements statements switch statement loop statements do while loop while loop loop each loop jump statements break statement continue statement decision making statements name suggests decision making statements decide which statement execute when decision making statements evaluate boolean expression control program flow depending upon result condition provided two types decision making statements java i e statement switch statement statement java statement used evaluate condition control program diverted depending upon specific condition condition statement gives boolean value either true false java four types statements given below simple statement else statement else ladder nested statement let s understand statements one one simple statement most basic statement among all control flow statements java evaluates boolean expression enables program enter block code expression evaluates true syntax statement given below condition statement executes when condition true consider following example which we have used statement java code student java student java public class student public static void main string args int x int y x y system out println x y greater than output x y greater than else statement else statement extension statement which uses another block code i e else block else block executed condition block evaluated false syntax condition statement executes when condition true else statement executes when condition false consider following example student java public class student public static void main string args int x int y x y system out println x y less than else system out println x y greater than output x y greater than else ladder else statement contains statement followed multiple else statements other words we can say chain else statements create decision tree where program may enter block code where condition true we can also define else statement end chain syntax else statement given below condition statement executes when condition true else condition statement executes when condition true else statement executes when all conditions false consider following example student java public class student public static void main string args string city delhi city meerut system out println city meerut else city noida system out println city noida else city agra system out println city agra else system out println city output delhi nested statement nested statements statement can contain else statement inside another else statement syntax nested statement given below condition statement executes when condition true condition statement executes when condition true else statement executes when condition false consider following example student java public class student public static void main string args string address delhi india address endswith india address contains meerut system out println your city meerut else address contains noida system out println your city noida else system out println address split else system out println you living india output delhi switch statement java switch statements similar else statements switch statement contains multiple blocks code called cases single case executed based variable which being switched switch statement easier use instead else statements also enhances readability program points noted about switch statement case variables can int short byte char enumeration string type also supported since version java cases cannot duplicate default statement executed when any case doesn t match value expression optional break statement terminates switch block when condition satisfied optional used next case executed while using switch statements we must notice case expression same type variable however also constant value syntax use switch statement given below switch expression case value statement break case valuen statementn break default default statement consider following example understand flow switch statement student java public class student implements cloneable public static void main string args int num switch num case system out println number break case system out println number break default system out println num output while using switch statements we must notice case expression same type variable however also constant value switch permits only int string enum type variables used loop statements programming sometimes we need execute block code repeatedly while some condition evaluates true however loop statements used execute set instructions repeated order execution set instructions depends upon particular condition java we have three types loops execute similarly however differences syntax condition checking time loop while loop do while loop let s understand loop statements one one java loop java loop similar c c enables us initialize loop variable check condition increment decrement single line code we use loop only when we exactly know number times we want execute block code initialization condition increment decrement block statements flow chart loop given below consider following example understand proper functioning loop java calculation java public class calculattion public static void main string args todo auto generated method stub int sum int j j j sum sum j system out println sum first natural numbers sum output sum first natural numbers java each loop java provides enhanced loop traverse data structures like array collection each loop we don t need update loop variable syntax use each loop java given below data type var array name collection name statements consider following example understand functioning each loop java calculation java public class calculation public static void main string args todo auto generated method stub string names java c c python javascript system out println printing content array names n string name names system out println name output printing content array names java c c python javascript java while loop while loop also used iterate over number statements multiple times however we don t know number iterations advance recommended use while loop unlike loop initialization increment decrement doesn t take place inside loop statement while loop also known entry controlled loop since condition checked start loop condition true loop body executed otherwise statements after loop executed syntax while loop given below while condition looping statements flow chart while loop given following image consider following example calculation java public class calculation public static void main string args todo auto generated method stub int i system out println printing list first even numbers n while i system out println i i i output printing list first even numbers java do while loop do while loop checks condition end loop after executing loop statements when number iteration known we have execute loop least once we can use do while loop also known exit controlled loop since condition checked advance syntax do while loop given below do statements while condition flow chart do while loop given following image consider following example understand functioning do while loop java calculation java public class calculation public static void main string args todo auto generated method stub int i system out println printing list first even numbers n do system out println i i i while i output printing list first even numbers jump statements jump statements used transfer control program specific statements other words jump statements transfer execution control other part program two types jump statements java i e break continue java break statement name suggests break statement used break current flow program transfer control next statement outside loop switch statement however breaks only inner loop case nested loop break statement cannot used independently java program i e can only written inside loop switch statement break statement example loop consider following example which we have used break statement loop breakexample java public class breakexample public static void main string args todo auto generated method stub int i i i system out println i i break output break statement example labeled loop calculation java public class calculation public static void main string args todo auto generated method stub int i i i b int j j j c int k k k system out println k k break output java continue statement unlike break statement continue statement doesn t break loop whereas skips specific part loop jumps next iteration loop immediately consider following example understand functioning continue statement java public class continueexample public static void main string args todo auto generated method stub int i i i int j i j j j continue system out println j output next topicjava else statement prev next videos join our youtube channel join now feedback send your feedback email protected help others
