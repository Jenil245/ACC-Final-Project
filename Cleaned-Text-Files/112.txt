reinforcement learning including mdp q learning rl tutorial you learn below topics what reinforcement learning terms used reinforcement learning key features reinforcement learning elements reinforcement learning approaches implementing reinforcement learning how does reinforcement learning work bellman equation types reinforcement learning reinforcement learning algorithm markov decision process what q learning difference between supervised learning reinforcement learning applications reinforcement learning conclusion what reinforcement learning reinforcement learning feedback based machine learning technique which agent learns behave environment performing actions seeing results actions each good action agent gets positive feedback each bad action agent gets negative feedback penalty reinforcement learning agent learns automatically using feedbacks without any labeled data unlike supervised learning since labeled data so agent bound learn its experience only rl solves specific type problem where decision making sequential goal long term game playing robotics etc agent interacts environment explores itself primary goal agent reinforcement learning improve performance getting maximum positive rewards agent learns process hit trial based experience learns perform task better way hence we can say reinforcement learning type machine learning method where intelligent agent computer program interacts environment learns act within how robotic dog learns movement his arms example reinforcement learning core part artificial intelligence all ai agent works concept reinforcement learning here we do need pre program agent learns from its own experience without any human intervention example suppose ai agent present within maze environment his goal find diamond agent interacts environment performing some actions based those actions state agent gets changed also receives reward penalty feedback agent continues doing three things take action change state remain same state get feedback doing actions he learns explores environment agent learns what actions lead positive feedback rewards what actions lead negative feedback penalty positive reward agent gets positive point penalty gets negative point terms used reinforcement learning agent entity can perceive explore environment act upon environment situation which agent present surrounded rl we assume stochastic environment which means random nature action actions moves taken agent within environment state state situation returned environment after each action taken agent reward feedback returned agent from environment evaluate action agent policy policy strategy applied agent next action based current state value expected long term retuned discount factor opposite short term reward q value mostly similar value takes one additional parameter current action key features reinforcement learning rl agent instructed about environment what actions need taken based hit trial process agent takes next action changes states according feedback previous action agent may get delayed reward environment stochastic agent needs explore reach get maximum positive rewards approaches implement reinforcement learning mainly three ways implement reinforcement learning ml which value based value based approach about find optimal value function which maximum value state under any policy therefore agent expects long term return any state s under policy policy based policy based approach find optimal policy maximum future rewards without using value function approach agent tries apply policy action performed each step helps maximize future reward policy based approach has mainly two types policy deterministic same action produced policy any state stochastic policy probability determines produced action model based model based approach virtual model created environment agent explores environment learn particular solution algorithm approach because model representation different each environment elements reinforcement learning four main elements reinforcement learning which given below policy reward signal value function model environment policy policy can defined way how agent behaves given time maps perceived states environment actions taken those states policy core element rl alone can define behavior agent some cases may simple function lookup table whereas other cases may involve general computation search process could deterministic stochastic policy deterministic policy s stochastic policy s p st s reward signal goal reinforcement learning defined reward signal each state environment sends immediate signal learning agent signal known reward signal rewards given according good bad actions taken agent agent s main objective maximize total number rewards good actions reward signal can change policy action selected agent leads low reward policy may change select other actions future value function value function gives information about how good situation action how much reward agent can expect reward indicates immediate signal each good bad action whereas value function specifies good state action future value function depends reward without reward could value goal estimating values achieve more rewards model last element reinforcement learning model which mimics behavior environment help model one can make inferences about how environment behave state action given model can predict next state reward model used planning which means provides way take course action considering all future situations before actually experiencing those situations approaches solving rl problems help model termed model based approach comparatively approach without using model called model free approach how does reinforcement learning work understand working process rl we need consider two main things environment can anything room maze football ground etc agent intelligent agent ai robot let s take example maze environment agent needs explore consider below image above image agent very first block maze maze consisting s block which wall s fire pit s diamond block agent cannot cross s block solid wall agent reaches s block get reward reaches fire pit gets reward point can take four actions move up move down move left move right agent can take any path reach final point he needs make possible fewer steps suppose agent considers path s s s s s so he get reward point agent try remember preceding steps has taken reach final step memorize steps assigns value each previous step consider below step now agent has successfully stored previous steps assigning value each previous block what agent do he starts moving from block which has value block both sides consider below diagram difficult condition agent whether he should go up down each block has same value so above approach suitable agent reach destination hence solve problem we use bellman equation which main concept behind reinforcement learning bellman equation bellman equation introduced mathematician richard ernest bellman year hence called bellman equation associated dynamic programming used calculate values decision problem certain point including values previous states way calculating value functions dynamic programming environment leads modern reinforcement learning key elements used bellman equations action performed agent referred state occurred performing action s reward feedback obtained each good bad action r discount factor gamma bellman equation can written v s max r s v s where v s value calculated particular point r s reward particular state s performing action discount factor v s value previous state above equation we taking max complete values because agent tries find optimal solution always so now using bellman equation we find value each state given environment we start from block which next target block st block v s max r s v s here v s because further state move v s max r s v s max v s nd block v s max r s v s here lets v s r s because reward state v s max v s max v s rd block v s max r s v s here lets v s r s because reward state also v s max v s max v s th block v s max r s v s here lets v s r s because reward state also v s max v s max v s th block v s max r s v s here lets v s r s because reward state also v s max v s max v s consider below image now we move further th block here agent may change route because always tries find optimal path so now let s consider from block next fire pit now agent has three options move he moves blue box he feel bump he moves fire pit he get reward here we taking only positive rewards so he move upwards only complete block values calculated using formula consider below image types reinforcement learning mainly two types reinforcement learning which positive reinforcement negative reinforcement positive reinforcement positive reinforcement learning means adding something increase tendency expected behavior would occur again impacts positively behavior agent increases strength behavior type reinforcement can sustain changes long time too much positive reinforcement may lead overload states can reduce consequences negative reinforcement negative reinforcement learning opposite positive reinforcement increases tendency specific behavior occur again avoiding negative condition can more effective than positive reinforcement depending situation behavior provides reinforcement only meet minimum behavior how represent agent state we can represent agent state using markov state contains all required information from history state st markov state follows given condition p st st p st s st markov state follows markov property which says future independent past can only defined present rl works fully observable environments where agent can observe environment act new state complete process known markov decision process which explained below markov decision process markov decision process mdp used formalize reinforcement learning problems environment completely observable its dynamic can modeled markov process mdp agent constantly interacts environment performs actions each action environment responds generates new state mdp used describe environment rl almost all rl problem can formalized using mdp mdp contains tuple four elements s pa ra set finite states s set finite actions rewards received after transitioning from state s state s due action probability pa mdp uses markov property better understand mdp we need learn about markov property says agent present current state s performs action move state s state transition from s s only depends current state future action states do depend past actions rewards states other words per markov property current state transition does depend any past action state hence mdp rl problem satisfies markov property chess game players only focus current state do need remember past actions states finite mdp finite mdp when finite states finite rewards finite actions rl we consider only finite mdp markov process markov process memoryless process sequence random states s s st uses markov property markov process also known markov chain which tuple s p state s transition function p two components s p can define dynamics system reinforcement learning algorithms reinforcement learning algorithms mainly used ai applications gaming applications main used algorithms q learning q learning off policy rl algorithm which used temporal difference learning temporal difference learning methods way comparing temporally successive predictions learns value function q s which means how good take action particular state s below flowchart explains working q learning state action reward state action sarsa sarsa stands state action reward state action which policy temporal difference learning method policy control method selects action each state while learning using specific policy goal sarsa calculate q s selected current policy all pairs s main difference between q learning sarsa algorithms unlike q learning maximum reward next state required updating q value table sarsa new action reward selected using same policy which has determined original action sarsa named because uses quintuple q s r s where s original state original action r reward observed while following states s new state action pair deep q neural network dqn name suggests dqn q learning using neural networks big state space environment challenging complex task define update q table solve issue we can use dqn algorithm where instead defining q table neural network approximates q values each action state now we expand q learning q learning explanation q learning popular model free reinforcement learning algorithm based bellman equation main objective q learning learn policy which can inform agent what actions should taken maximizing reward under what circumstances off policy rl attempts find best action take current state goal agent q learning maximize value q value q learning can derived from bellman equation consider bellman equation given below equation we have various components including reward discount factor probability end states s any q value given so first consider below image above image we can see agent who has three values options v s v s v s mdp so agent only cares current state future state agent can go any direction up left right so he needs decide where go optimal path here agent take move per probability bases changes state we want some exact moves so we need make some changes terms q value consider below image q represents quality actions each state so instead using value each state we use pair state action i e q s q value specifies which action more lubricative than others according best q value agent takes his next move bellman equation can used deriving q value perform any action agent get reward r s also he end up certain state so q value equation hence we can say v s max q s above formula used estimate q values q learning what q q learning q stands quality q learning which means specifies quality action taken agent q table q table matrix created while performing q learning table follows state action pair i e s initializes values zero after each action table updated q values stored within table rl agent uses q table reference table select best action based q values difference between reinforcement learning supervised learning reinforcement learning supervised learning both part machine learning both types learnings far opposite each other rl agents interact environment explore take action get rewarded whereas supervised learning algorithms learn from labeled dataset basis training predict output difference table between rl supervised learning given below reinforcement learning supervised learning rl works interacting environment supervised learning works existing dataset rl algorithm works like human brain works when making some decisions supervised learning works when human learns things supervision guide labeled dataset present labeled dataset present previous training provided learning agent training provided algorithm so can predict output rl helps take decisions sequentially supervised learning decisions made when input given reinforcement learning applications robotics rl used robot navigation robo soccer walking juggling etc control rl can used adaptive control factory processes admission control telecommunication helicopter pilot example reinforcement learning game playing rl can used game playing tic tac toe chess etc chemistry rl can used optimizing chemical reactions business rl now used business strategy planning manufacturing various automobile manufacturing companies robots use deep reinforcement learning pick goods put them some containers finance sector rl currently used finance sector evaluating trading strategies conclusion from above discussion we can say reinforcement learning one most interesting useful parts machine learning rl agent explores environment exploring without any human intervention main learning algorithm used artificial intelligence some cases where should used you
