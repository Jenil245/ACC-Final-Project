our computer network tutorial includes all topics computer network introduction features types computer network architecture hardware software internet intranet website lan wan etc what computer network computer network set devices connected through links node can computer printer any other device capable sending receiving data links connecting nodes known communication channels computer network uses distributed processing which task divided among several computers instead single computer handles entire task each separate computer handles subset following advantages distributed processing security provides limited interaction user can have entire system example bank allows users access own accounts through atm without allowing them access bank s entire database faster problem solving multiple computers can solve problem faster than single machine working alone security through redundancy multiple computers running same program same time can provide security through redundancy example four computers run same program any computer has hardware error other computers can override computer network tutorial index computer network computer network tutorial introduction
