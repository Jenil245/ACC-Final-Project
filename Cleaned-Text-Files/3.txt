java mcq next prev data types java data types specify different sizes values can stored variable two types data types java primitive data types primitive data types include boolean char byte short int long float double non primitive data types non primitive data types include classes interfaces arrays java primitive data types java language primitive data types building blocks data manipulation most basic data types available java language java statically typed programming language means all variables must declared before its use why we need declare variable s type name types primitive data types boolean data type byte data type char data type short data type int data type long data type float data type double data type data type default value default size boolean false bit char u byte byte byte short byte int byte long l byte float f byte double d byte boolean data type boolean data type used store only two possible values true false data type used simple flags track true false conditions boolean data type specifies one bit information its size can t defined precisely example boolean one false byte data type byte data type example primitive data type isan bit signed two s complement integer its value range lies between inclusive its minimum value maximum value its default value byte data type used save memory large arrays where memory savings most required saves space because byte times smaller than integer can also used place int data type example byte byte b short data type short data type bit signed two s complement integer its value range lies between inclusive its minimum value maximum value its default value short data type can also used save memory just like byte data type short data type times smaller than integer example short s short r int data type int data type bit signed two s complement integer its value range lies between inclusive its minimum value maximum value its default value int data type generally used default data type integral values unless problem about memory example int int b long data type long data type bit two s complement integer its value range lies between inclusive its minimum value maximum value its default value long data type used when you need range values more than those provided int example long l long b l float data type float data type single precision bit ieee floating point its value range unlimited recommended use float instead double you need save memory large arrays floating point numbers float data type should never used precise values currency its default value f example float f f double data type double data type double precision bit ieee floating point its value range unlimited double data type generally used decimal values just like float double data type also should never used precise values currency its default value d example double d char data type char data type single bit unicode character its value range lies between u uffff inclusive char data type used store characters example char lettera why char uses byte java what u because java uses unicode system ascii code system u lowest range unicode system get detail explanation about unicode visit next page
