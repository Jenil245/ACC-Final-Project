sort counting sort lower bound theory etc what algorithm finite set instruction specifies sequence operation carried out order solve specific problem class problems called algorithm why study algorithm speed processor increases performance frequently said less central than other software quality characteristics e g security extensibility reusability etc however large problem sizes commonplace area computational science which makes performance very important factor because longer computation time name few mean slower results less through research higher cost computation buying cpu hours from external party study algorithm therefore gives us language express performance function problem size daa tutorial index daa tutorial daa tutorial daa algorithm need algorithm complexity
