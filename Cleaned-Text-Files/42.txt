difficult display image any size computer screen method simplified using computer graphics graphics computer produced using various algorithms techniques tutorial describes how rich visual experience provided user explaining how all processed computer introduction computer graphics computer graphics involves technology access process transforms presents information visual form role computer graphics insensible today life computer graphics has now become common element user interfaces t v commercial motion pictures computer graphics creation pictures help computer end product computer graphics picture may business graph drawing engineering computer graphics two three dimensional pictures can created used research many hardware devices algorithm has been developing improving speed picture generation passes time includes creation storage models image objects models various fields like engineering mathematical so today computer graphics entirely different from earlier one possible interactive user can control structure object various input devices definition computer graphics use computers create manipulate pictures display device comprises software techniques create store modify represents pictures why computer graphics used suppose shoe manufacturing company want show sale shoes five years vast amount information store so lot time memory needed method tough understand common man situation graphics better alternative graphics tools charts graphs using graphs data can represented pictorial form picture can understood easily just single look interactive computer graphics work using concept two way communication between computer users computer receive signals from input device picture modified accordingly picture changed quickly when we apply command
