control systems introduction control system system which output controlled varying input first control system device james watt s flyball governor which invented aim inventing flyball governor keep speed engine constant regulating supply steam engine control system behavior system described differential equations differential equations can either ordinary differential equations difference equations two types control system open loop control system closed loop control system open loop control system open loop control system system which control action independent desired output signal system output signal compared input signal which means feedback signal system open loop control system also known non feedback control system control system without feedback examples automatic washing machine system operating time set manually after completion set time machine stops whether desired cleanness obtained because feedback signal which machine can sense immersion rod system rod heats up water how much hot water required cannot sensed rod advantages open loop control system open loop systems simple economical less maintenance required difficult disadvantages open loop control system open loop systems inaccurate systems reliable slow optimization possible closed loop control system closed loop control system system which control action dependent desired output system output signal compared reference input signal error signal produced error signal fed controller reduce error obtain desired output examples automatic electric iron servo voltage stabilizer air conditioner advantages closed loop systems systems more reliable closed loop systems faster many variables can handled simultaneously optimization possible disadvantages closed loop systems closed loop systems expensive maintenance difficult installation difficult systems difference between open loop system closed loop system s open loop system closed loop system easier build difficult build systems reliable systems reliable systems slow systems faster systems generally more stable systems less stable optimization possible optimization possible examples hand dryer washing machine servo voltage
