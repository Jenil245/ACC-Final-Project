artificial intelligence future ideas subsets ai subsets ai expert systems machine learning tutorial nlp tutorial artificial intelligence mcq artificial intelligence mcq related tutorials tensorflow tutorial pytorch tutorial data science tutorial reinforcement learning next artificial intelligence tutorial artificial intelligence tutorial provides introduction ai which help you understand concepts behind artificial intelligence tutorial we have also discussed various popular topics history ai applications ai deep learning machine learning natural language processing reinforcement learning q learning intelligent agents various search algorithms etc our ai tutorial prepared from elementary level so you can easily understand complete tutorial from basic concepts high level concepts what artificial intelligence today s world technology growing very fast we getting touch different new technologies day day here one booming technologies computer science artificial intelligence which ready create new revolution world making intelligent machines artificial intelligence now all around us currently working variety subfields ranging from general specific self driving cars playing chess proving theorems playing music painting etc ai one fascinating universal fields computer science which has great scope future ai holds tendency cause machine work human artificial intelligence composed two words artificial intelligence where artificial defines man made intelligence defines thinking power hence ai means man made thinking power so we can define ai branch computer science which we can create intelligent machines which can behave like human think like humans able make decisions artificial intelligence exists when machine can have human based skills learning reasoning solving problems artificial intelligence you do need preprogram machine do some work despite you can create machine programmed algorithms which can work own intelligence awesomeness ai believed ai new technology some people says per greek myth were mechanical men early days which can work behave like humans why artificial intelligence before learning about artificial intelligence we should know what importance ai why should we learn following some main reasons learn about ai help ai you can create software devices which can solve real world problems very easily accuracy health issues marketing traffic issues etc help ai you can create your personal virtual assistant cortana google assistant siri etc help ai you can build robots which can work environment where survival humans can risk ai opens path other new technologies new devices new opportunities goals artificial intelligence following main goals artificial intelligence replicate human intelligence solve knowledge intensive tasks intelligent connection perception action building machine which can perform tasks requires human intelligence proving theorem playing chess plan some surgical operation driving car traffic creating some system which can exhibit intelligent behavior learn new things itself demonstrate explain can advise its user what comprises artificial intelligence artificial intelligence just part computer science even s so vast requires lots other factors which can contribute create ai first we should know how intelligence composed so intelligence intangible part our brain which combination reasoning learning problem solving perception language understanding etc achieve above factors machine software artificial intelligence requires following discipline mathematics biology psychology sociology computer science neurons study statistics advantages artificial intelligence following some main advantages artificial intelligence high accuracy less errors ai machines systems prone less errors high accuracy takes decisions per pre experience information high speed ai systems can very high speed fast decision making because ai systems can beat chess champion chess game high reliability ai machines highly reliable can perform same action multiple times high accuracy useful risky areas ai machines can helpful situations defusing bomb exploring ocean floor where employ human can risky digital assistant ai can very useful provide digital assistant users ai technology currently used various e commerce websites show products per customer requirement useful public utility ai can very useful public utilities self driving car which can make our journey safer hassle free facial recognition security purpose natural language processing communicate human human language etc disadvantages artificial intelligence every technology has some disadvantages thesame goes artificial intelligence being so advantageous technology still has some disadvantages which we need keep our mind while creating ai system following disadvantages ai high cost hardware software requirement ai very costly requires lots maintenance meet current world requirements can t think out box even we making smarter machines ai still cannot work out box robot only do work which trained programmed feelings emotions ai machines can outstanding performer still does have feeling so cannot make any kind emotional attachment human may sometime harmful users proper care taken increase dependency machines increment technology people getting more dependent devices hence losing mental capabilities original creativity humans so creative can imagine some new ideas still ai machines cannot beat power human intelligence cannot creative imaginative prerequisite before learning about artificial intelligence you must have fundamental knowledge following so you can understand concepts easily any computer language c c java python etc knowledge python advantage knowledge essential mathematics derivatives probability theory etc audience our ai tutorial designed specifically beginners also included some high level concepts professionals
