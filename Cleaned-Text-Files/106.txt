both creating interface has methods interface void bydefault public abstract void b void c void d creating abstract class provides implementation one method interface abstract class b implements public void c system out println i am c creating subclass abstract class now we need provide implementation rest methods class m extends b public void system out println i am public void b system out println i am b public void d system out println i am d creating test class calls methods interface class test public static void main string args new m b c d test now output i am i am b i am c i am d
