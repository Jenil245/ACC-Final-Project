organization defines way system structured so all those catalogued tools can used properly our computer organization architecture tutorial includes all topics introduction er model keys relational model join operation sql functional dependency transaction concurrency control etc what computer architecture organization general terms architecture computer system can considered catalogue tools attributes visible user instruction sets number bits used data addressing techniques etc whereas organization computer system defines way system structured so all those catalogued tools can used significant components computer organization alu cpu memory memory organization prerequisite before learning concepts computer architecture organization you should have basic knowledge prior computer
