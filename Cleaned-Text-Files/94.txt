sqlite jquery jquery ui ajax swagger tutorial swagger swagger tutorial swagger standard way documenting standard apis swagger helpful when deploying apis azure swagger primarily used documenting api now question arises why document apis building apis internal enterprise public consumption theme same developers usually use apps building other developers able use our api api must properly documented otherwise how would know what endpoints exposed api what operations supported those endpoints what parameters should pass what get back what authentication methods use answer questions very important document apis you want apis consumed properly used swagger open api specification ways document api specifying what exactly apis can do what api api stands application programming interface defines how two pieces software talk each other several types apis swagger specifically deals web api how do web apis work let s understand working web api through example suppose we opened facebook our phone made request facebook server request sent facebook server known api request facebook server send response known api response server only send data whole web page responsibility app display web page here api definition works what requests available what response looks like each request swagger open api specification mainly designed rest api where rest type web api rest word r stands representational s stands state t stands transfer what api definition api definition file describes all things we can do api contains all requests we can make api also describes what request make how would response look like each request why create api definition several advantages writing api definition allows you design api before implementing developers can review api before writing code api also helps automated testing can automatically create code several languages can also used generate documentation automatically api definition file api definition file file contains all things you can do file file contains following things server location how security handled i e authorization all available resources api all different data you can send request what data returned what http status codes can returned anatomy request five different parts found http request method method describes action performed methods could post put delete get url specifies name which action performed query parameters headers headers used store information about request body body contains additional data url broken down several pieces example request url https api example com v user scheme https host api example com base path v path user note host base path would remain same api path differs depending upon request request body we mainly specify request body json format some methods put post etc body treated parameters like path url unlike parameters we create schema request body specifies how json body would look like rest response body could anything mainly response body written json format response body included response object response body has schema represent structured data we can also have separate response object each http status code returned security here security means authentication authorization authentication means validate user through username password authorization means allowing user access data security can set following ways none here none means security set access api basic auth means username password set each request api key key set access api oath authorization scheme documentation oas file api file contains human readable description elements generates documentation automatically other words we can say description section added api each operation which combination path method each parameter each response element structured data formats open api specification uses structured data format its api definition files we can use one two structured formats either yaml json yaml yaml stands ain t markup language markup language like html used data content yaml uses minimum characters compared json xml mainly used configuration files rather than files which passed over web like json key value pairs data yaml represented form key value pairs key value pairs indicated colon followed space example date first name john above example date first name keys john values levels levels indicated white space indenting we cannot use tab indent biggest difference between yaml other structured formats xml uses tags add one level inside tag other tags add another level so increases number characters json opening closing brackets indicate one level occupies many characters yaml only indentation used which occupies fewer characters xml name firstname john firstname lastname malik lastname name json name firstname john lastname malik yaml name firstname john lastname malik types types yaml determined from context example part description photoresistor price quantity above scenario part treated string description also treated string price treated floating type quantity treated integer note yaml we don t need quotes around strings one exception something interpreted number boolean quotes required list list yaml similar json we need use dash indicate list item we do need declare list cart part description photoresistor price quantity part b description led color blue price quantity we can observe above example cart name list two list items cart both list items represented dash first list item contains key value pairs whereas second list item contains key value pairs multi line strings we know strings do contain quotation marks so we need special characters multiline strings following characters used multi line strings preserves lines spaces means fold lines s yaml json above example we have used character so its output would same written above output yaml json we use character instead character s yaml json output yaml json history swagger historically swagger specification how create api definition file when new version released i e swagger specification became open api specification oas now swagger longer specification collection tools use open api specification oas many people refer oas swagger technically open api initiative open api initiative organization created consortium industry experts focused creating evolving promoting vendor neutral api description format charge open api specification charge any tools use before understanding what swagger we first understand what open api specification what open api specification initially named swagger specification later renamed open api specification open api specification specification where specification set rules specifies how do something therefore open api specification set rules describes how specify our restful apis language irrespective technology api use java php net something else we want our api easily consumed other developers building order understand api properly we should know all following about api what available endpoints like customers employees orders etc available operation each endpoint like get put post delete etc what operations available each endpoint exposed our api what parameters pass data types what api return its data type authentication methods use we want our external world even our internal clients should know about our api without necessarily sharing source code so must some set rules standards we should follow describe api everyone follow same set rules describe api same way here open api specification plays role simply defines set rules specifies how describe restful apis have rules describes every aspect restful service certain rules specify available endpoints api similarly rules specify operation each endpoint basically rules everything example parameters data types return values authentication methods etc open api specification can also defined standard language agnostic way describe restful api idea create document following rules either json yaml format describes your entire api available endpoints available operations what parameters pass return value data types authentication methods let s see how build oas file we consider example build file suppose company name javatpoint com api service uploading sharing photos here api base url https api javatpoint com photo following example how start file every open api contains swagger document metadata info version title photo service host api javatpoint com basepath photo schemes https above code open api specification calls swagger before writing open api specification next step write about file itself which done key info under info we have version string title api after title host api api javatpoint com basepath photo because url api javatpoint com photo list schemes which case only has schemes adding request let s define requests getting photo albums following information included request url endpoint http method path parameters query parameters let s understand query parameters through example get https api javatpoint com photo album start end api definition file endpoints paths photo album album get one more albums get query parameters parameters starting date name start query required false type string ending date name end query required false type string starts paths key which list keys other words we can say list operations url grouped paths key key starts album which means url ends album method returns one more albums uses get method so we put after album get method has list parameters above yaml list begins because api definition file has list query parameters list has keys name key denotes name parameter key defines parameter query based parameter required above value key false which means optional field type key defines type parameter now we retrieve album specific id suppose url retrieving specific album given below get https api javatpoint com photo album above url retrieve specific url having unique id let s look definition photo album album id get album get query parameters parameters album id name id path required true type integer above yaml key defined album id where id defined within curly brackets indicates path parameter defined later name id we have get method we included parameter list here we have added only one list item named id value path which means path parameter required field true which always case path parameter type integer what schema certain kind requests require extra data post put method methods known http methods body includes methods known request body data included request body can formatted either json xml format all responses represented response body can formatted json format here schema mainly defines structure data oas schema object based off json schema specification schema data determines what keys key value pairs what type data values can many levels schema ref ref special oas key indicates value reference structure somewhere else yaml file useful so we do have so many indentation levels yaml file let s understand through example file name album body required true schema ref definitions newalbum file definitions newalbum properties name type string file we have defined ref key inside schema having value definitions newalbum we have created one more file named file where we have defined new key named definitions which has one more key named newalbum indentation structure reflected ref key file request body request body contains parameters defined under parameters key following list parameters name just written reference shown documentation has key which set body required key which typically set true schema instead type has schema key which has key ref ref contains value reference path quotes example request body post query parameters parameters name album body required true schema ref definitions newalbum above yaml has post request contains parameters key parameters has list name album has schema contains ref key intended path schema schema section schema section we create key called definitions end file we add level give name from ref value add properties key each top element json add key its name add type key says what type key add other keys other data example schema definitions newalbum properties name type string date type string above schema we can observe newalbum has two properties named name date both string type note values key value don t have simple type we can add other objects values do we need follow steps which given below first we need use type object we need add new level properties we continue we did before author type object properties first name type string last name type string above schema we can observe schema type object followed properties key properties key has two properties named first name last name type string above file has lots indentation overcome problem we can use ref from within your definition let s understand through example author ref definitions person person properties first name type string last name type string above case author key has ref key indicates path definition person key person has properties key has two properties named first name last name schema array we can also add arrays we use type array we add key items define type any other properties syntax declaring schema array marks type array items type string above example marks array having items type string schema array ref complex type we use ref array items let s understand through example photos type array items ref definitions photo photo properties id type integer longitude type number latitude type number above schema photos key type array has list items intended path photo key photo key has three properties i e id type integer longitude type number latitude type number what swagger swagger provides editor open api specification files visit swagger editor website go following link http editor swagger io swagger one popular tools used generating interactive documentation generates interactive api users so can understand about api more quickly difference between swagger open api specification openapi specification whereas swagger tool used implementing specification development openapi specification done openapi initiative involves more than organizations from different areas world smartbear software company developed swagger tool also member openapi initiative so also helped developing specification swagger tool associated widely used tools implementing openapi specification swagger toolset includes open source free commercial tools used different stages api lifecycle following tools included swagger swagger editor tool allows us edit open api specifications yaml inside browser can also preview documentation real time swagger ui tool which collection html javascript css assets allows us generate beautiful documentation dynamically swagger codegen allows us generate api client libraries server stubs documentation automatically swagger core consists java related libraries which used creating consuming working api definitions swagger inspector api testing tool allows you validate your apis generate openapi definitions from existing api documentation swagger what autogenerated documentation tools swagger takes oas files generate html documentation from so can updated web long oas file kept up date documentation likely more accurate rather than writing documentation manually also allows you try out requests from within documentation so can help developer implementing code we design document restful api using swagger editor suppose we have student api resource from which we get students name based query parameter query parameter we pass student name api we also have post operation adds new student help api we also perform get operation retrieves data help path parameter open swagger editor browser shown below very intelligent tool provides bunch suggestions when we press ctrl space provides you lots suggestions first we use openapi having version shown below now we add basic information our api metadata shown below above we have added basic information title api description api contact api next we have add servers we can add multiple servers adding url each server after adding server we add path inside path we need add resource path well operations above we have added student resource along its description we have included get operation first we provided description get method we include parameters we going pass get method we have passed query based parameter named studentname next parameter required which true studentname parameter mandatory get method now we represent schema query based parameter inside schema we have included type parameter example case we have specified query parameter now we specify response should next level we first mention responses inside responses we need specify http code which we showing responses real scenario we should cover all major response codes here we specify happy scenario i e code representing successful response after response code we specify description response code successful response we specify format content i e application json means content represented json format once format content included we need specify schema since response so get operation performed type operation array array has list items so we specify items key items has properties key we can observe above screenshot contains three properties i e student id type integer student name type string studentremarks type string next operation post operation we have perform first we specify post method editor we add description post method add new student inside post method we need specify requestbody expecting requestbody json format student object content we add format content i e application json since post operation so we expecting have object type rather than array type all properties post operation would same get operation after adding all properties we add responses key which we add code represents happy scenario under responses key we add description response code i e record successfully added till now we getting student resource query parameter suppose we want get student resource path parameter we need add following code path student id description retrieve student based path parameter get parameters path name id required true schema type integer responses description success response path parameter content application json below file complete api definition file openapi info title student api description student api javatpoint com contact name javatpoint url http javatpoint com version server url http devapi com paths student description student resource get description operation fetch student data parameters query name studentname required true schema type string example john responses description successful response content application json schema type array items properties student id type integer example student name type string example peter student remarks type string example high grade student post description add new student requestbody content application json schema type object properties student id type integer example student name type string example peter student remarks type string example high grade student responses description record successfully added student id description retrieve student based path parameter get parameters path name id required true schema type integer responses description success response path parameter content application json schema type array items properties student id type integer example student name type string example peter student remarks type string example high grade student output above screenshots show api perform three operations first operation get operation accepting student name second operation post operation accepting requestbody json format third operation get operation accepting path parameter named id
