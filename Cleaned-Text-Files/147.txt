provides runtime environment which java bytecode can executed jvms available many hardware software platforms i e jvm platform dependent what jvm specification where working java virtual machine specified implementation provider independent choose algorithm its implementation has been provided oracle other companies implementation its implementation known jre java runtime environment runtime instance whenever you write java command command prompt run java class instance jvm created what does jvm performs following operation loads code verifies code executes code provides runtime environment jvm provides definitions memory area class file format register set garbage collected heap fatal error reporting etc jvm architecture let s understand internal architecture jvm contains classloader memory area execution engine etc classloader classloader subsystem jvm which used load class files whenever we run java program loaded first classloader three built classloaders java bootstrap classloader first classloader which super class extension classloader loads rt jar file which contains all class files java standard edition like java lang package classes java net package classes java util package classes java io package classes java sql package classes etc extension classloader child classloader bootstrap parent classloader system classloader loades jar files located inside java home jre lib ext directory system application classloader child classloader extension classloader loads classfiles from classpath default classpath set current directory you can change classpath using cp classpath switch also known application classloader let s see example print classloader name public class classloaderexample public static void main string args let s print classloader name current class application system classloader load class class c classloaderexample class system out println c getclassloader we print classloader name string print null because built class which found rt jar so loaded bootstrap classloader system out println string class getclassloader test now output email protected null internal classloaders provided java you want create your own classloader you need extend classloader class class method area class method area stores per class structures runtime constant pool field method data code methods heap runtime data area which objects allocated stack java stack stores frames holds local variables partial results plays part method invocation return each thread has private jvm stack created same time thread new frame created each time method invoked frame destroyed when its method invocation completes program counter register pc program counter register contains address java virtual machine instruction currently being executed native method stack contains all native methods used application execution engine contains virtual processor interpreter read bytecode stream execute instructions just time jit compiler used improve performance jit compiles parts byte code have similar functionality same time hence reduces amount time needed compilation here term compiler refers translator from instruction set java
