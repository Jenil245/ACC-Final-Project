create graphics pictures games developed wally feurzeig seymour parpet cynthina slolomon part original logo programming language logo programming language popular among kids because enables us draw attractive graphs screen simple way like little object screen which can move according desired position similarly turtle library comes interactive feature gives flexibility work python tutorial we learn basic concepts turtle library how set turtle up computer programming python turtle library few important turtle commands develop short attractive design using python turtle library introduction turtle pre installed library python similar virtual canvas we can draw pictures attractive shapes provides onscreen pen we can use drawing turtle library primarily designed introduce children world programming help turtle s library new programmers can get idea how we can do programming python fun interactive way beneficial children experienced programmer because allows designing unique shapes attractive pictures various games we can also design mini games animation upcoming section we learn various functionality turtle library getting started turtle before working turtle library we must ensure two most essential things do programming python environment we must familiar working python environment we can use applications idle jupiter notebook we can also use python interactive shell python version we must have python our system download from python s official website turtle built library so we don t need install separately we just need import library our python environment python turtle library consists all important methods functions we need create our designs images import turtle library using following command import turtle now we can access all methods functions first we need create dedicated window where we carry out each drawing command we can do initializing variable s turtle getscreen look like above image little triangle middle screen turtle screen appearing your computer system use below code example import turtle creating turtle screen s turtle getscreen stop screen display turtle mainloop output screen same canvas turtle acts like pen you can move turtle design desired shape turtle has certain changeable features color speed size can moved specific direction move direction unless we tell otherwise next section we learn program python turtle library programming turtle first we need learn move turtle all direction we want we can customize pen like turtle its environment let s learn couple commands perform few specific tasks turtle can moved four directions forward backward left right turtle motion turtle can move forward backward direction s facing let s see following functions forward distance turtle fd distance moves turtle forward direction certain distance takes one parameter distance which can integer float example import turtle creating turtle screen t turtle turtle stop screen display t forward turtle mainloop output back distance turtle bk turtle backward distance method moves turtle opposite direction turtle headed doesn t change turtle heading example import turtle creating turtle screen t turtle turtle move turtle opposite direction t backward stop screen display turtle mainloop output right angle turtle rt angle method moves turtle right angle units example import turtle creating turtle screen t turtle turtle t heading move turtle opposite direction t right t heading stop screen display turtle mainloop output left angle turtle lt angle method turn turtle left angle units let s understand following example example import turtle creating turtle screen t turtle turtle t heading move turtle left t left t heading stop screen display turtle mainloop output screen initially divided four quadrants turtle positioned beginning program known home goto x y none turtle setpos x y none turtle setposition x y none method used move turtle other area screen takes two coordinates x y consider following example example import turtle creating turtle screen t turtle turtle move turtle coordinates t goto stop screen display turtle mainloop output drawing shape we discussed movement turtle now we learn move making actual shape first we draw polygon since all consist straight lines connected certain angles let s understand following example example t fd t rt t fd t rt t fd t rt t fd look like following image output we can draw any shape using turtle rectangle triangle square many more we need take care coordinate while drawing rectangle because all four sides equal once we draw rectangle we can even try creating other polygons increasing number side drawing preset figures suppose you want draw circle you attempt draw same way you drew square would extremely tedious you d have spend lot time just one shape thankfully python turtle library provides solution you can use single command draw circle circle radius extent none steps integer used draw circle screen takes three arguments radius can number extent can number none steps can integer circle drawn given radius extent determines which part circle drawn extent provided none draw entire circle let s understand following example example import turtle creating turtle screen t turtle turtle t circle turtle mainloop output we can also draw dot which also known filled circle follow given method draw filled circle example import turtle creating turtle screen t turtle turtle t dot turtle mainloop output number we have passed dot function diameter dot we can increase decrease size dot changing its diameter so far we have learned movement turtle design various shapes next few sections we learn customization turtle its environment changing screen color default turtle screen opened white background however we can modify background color screen using following function example import turtle creating turtle screen t turtle turtle turtle bgcolor red turtle mainloop output we have passed red color we can also replace any color we can use hex code use variety code our screen adding image background same screen background color we can add background image using following function bgpic picname none sets background image return name current background image takes one argument picname which can string name gif file nopic none picname nopic delete background image let s see following example example import turtle creating turtle turtle t turtle turtle turtle bgpic turtle bgpic r c users devansh sharma downloads person jpg turtle bgpic turtle mainloop changing image size we can change image size using screensize function syntax given below syntax turtle screensize canvwidth none canvheight none bg none parameter takes three parameters canvwidth can positive number new canvas width pixel canvheight can positive number new height canvas pixel bg colorstring color tuple new background color let s understand following example example import turtle creating turtle turtle t turtle turtle turtle screensize turtle screensize turtle screensize turtle mainloop output changing screen title sometimes we want change title screen default shows python tutorial graphics we can make personal my first turtle program drawing shape python we can change title screen using following function turtle title your title let s see example example import turtle creating turtle t turtle turtle turtle title my turtle program turtle mainloop output you can change screen title according preference changing pen size we can increase decrease turtle s size according requirement sometimes we need thickness pen we can do using following example example import turtle creating turtle turtle t turtle turtle t pensize t forward turtle mainloop output we can see above image pen four times original size we can use draw lines various sizes pen color control default when we open new screen turtle comes up black color draws black ink we can change according two things we can change color turtle which fill color we can change pen s color which basically change outline ink color we can also change both pen color turtle color we want we suggest increasing size turtle changes color can clearly visible let s understand following code example import turtle creating turtle turtle t turtle turtle increase turtle size t shapesize fill color t fillcolor blue change pen color t pencolor yellow turtle mainloop output type following function change color both example import turtle creating turtle turtle t turtle turtle t shapesize chnage color both t color green red t forward turtle mainloop output explanation above code first color pen color second fill color turtle fill image colors make image shapes very attractive we can fill shapes various colors let s understand following example add color drawings let s understand following example example import turtle creating turtle turtle t turtle turtle t shapesize t begin fill t fd t lt t fd t lt t fd t end fill turtle mainloop output explanation when program executes draw first triangle filled solid black color above output we have used begin fill method which indicates we draw closed shape filled we use end fill which indicates we have done creating shape now can filled color changing turtle shape default turtle shape triangular however we can change turtle s shape module provides many shapes turtle let s understand following example example import turtle creating turtle turtle t turtle turtle t shape turtle change arrow t shape arrow chnage circle t shape circle turtle mainloop output we can change turtle shape according requirement shapes can square triangle classic turtle arrow circle classic original shape turtle changing pen speed speed turtle can changed generally moves moderate sped over screen we can increase decrease its speed below method modify turtle speed example import turtle creating turtle t turtle turtle t speed t forward t speed t forward turtle mainloop output turtle speed can vary integer values range argument passed speed function returns current speed speed strings mapped speed values follows fastest fast normal slow slowest note speed assigned zero means animation take place turtle speed turtle speed normal turtle speed turtle speed turtle speed customization one line suppose we want multiple changes within turtle we can do using just one line below few characteristics turtle pen color should red fill color should orange pen size should pen speed should background color should blue let s see following example example import turtle creating turtle t turtle turtle t pencolor red t fillcolor orange t pensize t speed t begin fill t circle turtle bgcolor blue t end fill turtle mainloop output we used just one line changed turtle s characteristics learn about command you can learn from library official documentation change pen direction default turtle points right screen sometimes we require moving turtle other side screen itself accomplish we can use penup method pendown function uses start drawing again consider following example example import turtle creating turtle t turtle turtle t fd t rt t penup t fd t rt t pendown t fd t rt t penup t fd t pendown turtle mainloop output we can see above output we have obtained two parallel lines instead square clearing screen we have covered most designing concepts turtle sometimes we need clear screen draw more designs we can do using following function t clear above method clear screen so we can draw more designs function only removes existing designs shapes make any changes variable turtle remain same position resetting environment we can also reset current working using reset function restores turle s setting clears screen we just need use following function t reset all tasks removed turtle back its home position default settings turtle color size shape other features restored we have learned basic fundamental turtle programming now we discuss few essential advanced concepts turtle library leaving stamp we can leave stamp turtle screen stamp nothing imprint turtle let s understand following example example import turtle creating turtle t turtle turtle t stamp t fd t stamp t fd turtle mainloop output we print stamp method display number which nothing turtle s location stamp id we can also remove particular stamp using following command t clearstamp stamp location cloning turtle sometimes we look multiple turtle design unique shape provides facility clone current working turtle environment we can move both turtle screen let s understand following example example import turtle creating turtle t turtle turtle c t clone t color blue c color red t circle c circle i range c circle i turtle mainloop output explanation above code we cloned turtle c variable called circle function first draws blue circle draw outer circles based loop conditions next section we discuss how we can use python conditional loop statements create design using turtle turtle programming using loops conditional statements we have learned basic advanced concepts turtle library so far next step explore those concepts python s loops conditional statements give us practical approach when comes understanding concepts before moving further we should remember following concepts loops used repeat set code until particular condition matched conditional statements used perform task based specific conditions indentation used define block code essential when we using loops conditional statements indentation nothing set whitespaces statements same level considered same block statements let s understand following examples loops previous example we wrote multiple repeated lines our code here we implement create square program using loop example example t fd t rt t fd t rt t fd t rt t fd t rt we can make shorter using loop run below code example import turtle creating turtle t turtle turtle i range t fd t rt turtle mainloop output explanation above code loop repeated code until reached counter i like counter starts from zero keep increasing one let s understand above loop execution step step first iteration i turtle moves forward units turns degrees right second iteration i turtle moves forward units turns degrees right third iteration i turtle moves forward units turns degrees right third iteration i turtle moves forward units turns degrees right after completing iteration turtle jump out loop while loops used run block code until condition satisfied code terminated when finds false condition let s understand following example example import turtle creating turtle t turtle turtle n while n t circle n n n turtle mainloop output we can see output we draw multiple circles using while loop every time loop executes new circle larger than previous one n used counter where we specified value n increase each iteration let s understand iteration loop first iteration initial value n means turtle draw circle radius units second iteration value n increased turtle draws circle radius units second iteration value n increased turtle draws circle radius units second iteration value n increased turtle draws circle radius units conditional statement conditional statement used check whether given condition true true execute corresponding lines code let s understand following example example import turtle creating turtle t turtle turtle n n t circle n else t forward n t backward n turtle mainloop output explanation above program we define two outcomes based user input entered number less equal than means draw circle otherwise else part we gave input so block got executed drew circle now let s move see few cool designs using turtle library attractive designs using python turtle library we have learned basic advance concepts python turtle library we explain every possible feature library using its function we can design games unique shapes many more things here we mention few designs using turtle library design circle spiro graph code import turtle
