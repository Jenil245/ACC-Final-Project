internationalization interview questions next prev method overriding java understanding problem without method overriding can we override static method method overloading vs method overriding subclass child class has same method declared parent class known method overriding java other words subclass provides specific implementation method has been declared one its parent class known method overriding usage java method overriding method overriding used provide specific implementation method which already provided its superclass method overriding used runtime polymorphism rules java method overriding method must have same name parent class method must have same parameter parent class must relationship inheritance understanding problem without method overriding let s understand problem we may face program we don t use method overriding java program demonstrate why we need method overriding here we calling method parent class child class object creating parent class class vehicle void run system out println vehicle running creating child class class bike extends vehicle public static void main string args creating instance child class bike obj new bike calling method child class instance obj run test now output vehicle running problem i have provide specific implementation run method subclass why we use method overriding example method overriding example we have defined run method subclass defined parent class has some specific implementation name parameter method same relationship between classes so method overriding java program illustrate use java method overriding creating parent class class vehicle defining method void run system out println vehicle running creating child class class bike extends vehicle defining same method parent class void run system out println bike running safely public static void main string args bike obj new bike creating object obj run calling method test now output bike running safely real example java method overriding consider scenario where bank class provides functionality get rate interest however rate interest varies according banks example sbi icici axis banks could provide rate interest java method overriding mostly used runtime polymorphism which we learn next pages java program demonstrate real scenario java method overriding where three classes overriding method parent class creating parent class class bank int getrateofinterest return creating child classes class sbi extends bank int getrateofinterest return class icici extends bank int getrateofinterest return class axis extends bank int getrateofinterest return test class create objects call methods class test public static void main string args sbi s new sbi icici i new icici axis new axis system out println sbi rate interest s getrateofinterest system out println icici rate interest i getrateofinterest system out println axis rate interest getrateofinterest test now output sbi rate interest icici rate interest axis rate interest can we override static method static method cannot overridden can proved runtime polymorphism so we learn later why can we override static method because static method bound class whereas instance method bound object static belongs class area instance belongs heap area can we override java main method because main static method difference between method overloading method overriding
