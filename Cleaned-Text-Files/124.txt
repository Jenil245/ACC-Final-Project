blockchain interview questions bitcoin interview questions next blockchain tutorial blockchain tutorial provides basic advanced concepts blockchain blockchain constantly growing ledger keeps permanent record all transactions have taken place secure chronological immutable way can used secure transfer money property contracts etc without requiring third party intermediary bank government blockchain software protocol could run without internet like smtp email what blockchain blockchain constantly growing ledger which keeps permanent record all transactions have taken place secure chronological immutable way let s breakdown definition ledger file constantly growing permanent means once transaction goes inside blockchain you can put up permanently ledger secure blockchain placed information secure way uses very advanced cryptography make sure information locked inside blockchain chronological chronological means every transaction happens after previous one immutable means you build all transaction onto blockchain ledger can never changed blockchain chain blocks which contain information each block records all recent transactions once completed goes blockchain permanent database each time block gets completed new block generated note blockchain can used secure transfer money property contracts etc without requiring third party intermediary like bank government blockchain software protocol could run without internet like smtp used email who uses blockchain blockchain technology can integrated multiple areas primary use blockchains distributed ledger cryptocurrencies shows great promise across wide range business applications like banking finance government healthcare insurance media entertainment retail etc need blockchain blockchain technology has become popular because following time reduction financial industry blockchain can allow quicker settlement trades does take lengthy process verification settlement clearance because single version agreed upon data available between all stakeholders unchangeable transactions blockchain register transactions chronological order which certifies unalterability all operations means when new block added chain ledgers cannot removed modified reliability blockchain certifies verifies identities each interested parties removes double records reducing rates accelerates transactions security blockchain uses very advanced cryptography make sure information locked inside blockchain uses distributed ledger technology where each party holds copy original chain so system remains operative even large number other nodes fall collaboration allows each party transact directly each other without requiring third party intermediary decentralized decentralized because central authority supervising anything standards rules how every node exchanges blockchain information method ensures all transactions validated all valid transactions added one one blockchain tutorial index blockchain tutorial history blockchain what bitcoin
