concepts data analysis visualization r software environment which used analyze statistical information graphical representation r allows us do modular programming using functions our r tutorial includes all topics r introduction features installation rstudio ide variables datatypes operators statement vector data handing graphics statistical modelling etc programming language named r based first name letter two authors robert gentleman ross ihaka what r programming r interpreted computer programming language which created ross ihaka robert gentleman university auckland new zealand r development core team currently develops r also software environment used analyze statistical information graphical representation reporting data modeling r implementation s programming language which combined lexical scoping semantics r only allows us do branching looping also allows do modular programming using functions r allows integration procedures written c c net python fortran languages improve efficiency present era r one most important tool which used researchers data analyst statisticians marketers retrieving cleaning analyzing visualizing presenting data history r programming history r goes back about years ago r developed ross lhaka robert gentleman university auckland new zealand r development core team currently develops programming language name taken from name both developers first project considered initial version released stable beta version released following table shows release date version description r language version release date description first time r s source released cran comprehensive r archive network started r officially gets gnu license update packages install packages both included first production ready version released first version mac os made available first version mac os made available add support utf encoding internationalization localization etc add support windows bit systems added function rapidly converts code byte code added some new packages improved serialization speed long vectors support larger numeric values bit systems just time compilation jit enabled default added new features compact internal representation integer sequences serialization format etc features r programming r domain specific programming language which aims do data analysis has some unique features which make very powerful most important arguably being notation vectors vectors allow us perform complex operation set values single command following features r programming simple effective programming language which has been well developed data analysis software well designed easy effective language which has concepts user defined looping conditional various i o facilities has consistent incorporated set tools which used data analysis different types calculation arrays lists vectors r contains suite operators provides effective data handling storage facility open source powerful highly extensible software provides highly extensible graphical techniques allows us perform multiple calculations using vectors r interpreted language why use r programming several tools available market perform data analysis learning new languages time taken data scientist can use two excellent tools i e r python we may have time learn them both time when we get started learn data science learning statistical modeling algorithm more important than learn programming language programming language used compute communicate our discovery important task data science way we deal data clean feature engineering feature selection import should our primary focus data scientist job understand data manipulate expose best approach machine learning best algorithms can implemented r keras tensorflow allow us create high end machine learning techniques r has package perform xgboost xgboost one best algorithms kaggle competition r communicate other languages possibly calls python java c big data world also accessible r we can connect r different databases like spark hadoop brief r great tool investigate explore data elaborate analysis clustering correlation data reduction done r comparison between r python data science deals identifying extracting representing meaningful information from data source r python sas sql tableau matlab etc most useful tools data science r python most used ones still becomes confusing choose better most suitable one among two r python comparison index r python overview r interpreted computer programming language which created ross ihaka robert gentleman university auckland new zealand r development core team currently develops r r also software environment which used analyze statistical information graphical representation reporting data modeling python interpreted high level programming language used general purpose programming guido van rossum created first released python has very simple clean code syntax emphasizes code readability debugging also simple easier python specialties data science r packages have advanced techniques which very useful statistical work cran text view provided many useful r packages packages cover everything from psychometrics genetics finance finding outliers data set both r python equally good developing web service allow peoples upload datasets find outliers python better functionalities data analysis r has inbuilt functionalities most data analysis functionalities inbuilt available through packages like numpy pandas key domains application data visualization key aspect analysis r packages ggplot ggvis lattice etc make data visualization easier python better deep learning because python packages caffe keras opennn etc allows development deep neural network very simple way availability packages hundreds packages ways accomplish needful data science tasks python has few main packages viz sccikit learn pandas data analysis machine learning respectively applications r several applications available real time some popular applications follows facebook google twitter hrdag sunlight foundation realclimate ndaa xbox one anz fda prerequisite r programming used statistical information data representation so required we should have knowledge statistical theory mathematics understanding different types graphs data representation most important we should have prior knowledge any programming audience tutorial helpful those students who interested gaining knowledge how data analysis projects implemented tutorial covers all basics r how data analysis done using r problems we assure you you find any
