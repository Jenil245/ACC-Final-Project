many informations id name emailid etc contains one more object named address which contains its own informations city state country zipcode etc given below class employee int id string name address address address class case employee has entity reference address so relationship employee has address why use aggregation code reusability simple example aggregation example we have created reference operation class circle class class operation int square int n return n n class circle operation op aggregation double pi double area int radius op new operation int rsquare op square radius code reusability i e delegates method call return pi rsquare public static void main string args circle c new circle double result c area system out println result test now output when use aggregation code reuse also best achieved aggregation when relationship inheritance should used only relationship maintained throughout lifetime objects involved otherwise aggregation best choice understanding meaningful example aggregation example employee has object address address object contains its own informations city state country etc case relationship employee has address address java public class address string city state country public address string city string state string country city city state state country country emp java public class emp int id string name address address public emp int id string name address address id id name name address address void display system out println id name system out println address city address state address country public static void main string
