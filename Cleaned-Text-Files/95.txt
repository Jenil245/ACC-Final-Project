we have designed tutorial after completion deep research about every concept content described detailed manner has ability answer most your queries tutorial also contains numerical examples based previous year gate questions which help you address problems practical manner operating system can defined interface between user hardware provides environment user so user can perform its task convenient efficient way operating system tutorial divided various parts based its functions process management process synchronization deadlocks file management operating system definition function computer system comprises hardware software hardware can only understand machine code form which doesn t make any sense naive user we need system which can act intermediary manage all processes resources present system operating system can defined interface between user hardware responsible execution all processes resource allocation cpu management file management many other tasks purpose operating system provide environment which user can execute programs convenient efficient manner structure computer system computer system consists users people who using computer application programs compilers databases games video player browsers etc system programs shells editors compilers etc operating system special program which acts interface between user hardware hardware cpu disks memory
