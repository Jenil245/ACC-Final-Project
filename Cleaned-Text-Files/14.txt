implemented class whose object clone we want create we don t implement cloneable interface clone method generates clonenotsupportedexception clone method defined object class syntax clone method follows protected object clone throws clonenotsupportedexception why use clone method clone method saves extra processing task creating exact copy object we perform using new keyword take lot processing time performed why we use object cloning advantage object cloning although object clone has some design issues still popular easy way copying objects following list advantages using clone method you don t need write lengthy repetitive codes just use abstract class line long clone method easiest most efficient way copying objects especially we applying already developed old project just define parent class implement cloneable provide definition clone method task done clone fastest way copy array disadvantage object cloning following list some disadvantages clone method use object clone method we have change lot syntaxes our code like implementing cloneable interface defining clone method handling clonenotsupportedexception finally calling object clone etc we have implement cloneable interface while doesn t have any methods we just have use tell jvm we can perform clone our object object clone protected so we have provide our own clone indirectly call object clone from object clone doesn t invoke any constructor so we don t have any control over object construction you want write clone method child class all its superclasses should define clone method them inherit from another parent class otherwise super clone chain fail object clone supports only shallow copying we need override we need deep cloning example clone method object cloning let s see simple example object cloning class student implements cloneable int rollno string name student int rollno string name rollno rollno name name public object clone throws clonenotsupportedexception return super clone public static void main string args try student s new student amit student s student s clone system out println s rollno s name system out println s rollno s name catch clonenotsupportedexception c test now output amit amit download example object cloning you can see above example both reference variables have same value thus clone copies values object another so we don t need write explicit code copy value object another we create another object new keyword assign values another object one require lot processing object so save extra processing task we use clone method next topicjava math
