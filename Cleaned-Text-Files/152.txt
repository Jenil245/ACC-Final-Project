socket programming provides facility share data between different computing devices advantage java networking sharing resources centralize software management do you know how perform connection oriented socket programming networking how display data any online web page how get ip address any host name e g www google com how perform connection less socket programming networking java net package supports two protocols tcp transmission control protocol provides reliable communication between sender receiver tcp used along internet protocol referred tcp ip udp user datagram protocol provides connection less protocol service allowing packet data transferred along two more nodes java networking terminology widely used java networking terminologies given below ip address protocol port number mac address connection oriented connection less protocol socket ip address ip address unique number assigned node network e g composed octets range from logical address can changed protocol protocol set rules basically followed communication example tcp ftp telnet smtp pop etc port number port number used uniquely identify different applications acts communication endpoint between applications port number associated ip address communication between two applications mac address mac media access control address unique identifier nic network interface controller network node can have multiple nic each unique mac address example ethernet card may have mac address d b c e connection oriented connection less protocol connection oriented protocol acknowledgement sent receiver so reliable slow example connection oriented protocol tcp connection less protocol acknowledgement sent receiver so reliable fast example connection less protocol udp socket socket endpoint
