data science non technical prerequisite curiosity learn data science one must have curiosities when you have curiosity ask various questions you can understand business problem easily critical thinking also required data scientist so you can find multiple new ways solve problem efficiency communication skills communication skills most important data scientist because after solving business problem you need communicate team technical prerequisite machine learning understand data science one needs understand concept machine learning data science uses machine learning algorithms solve various problems mathematical modeling mathematical modeling required make fast mathematical calculations predictions from available data statistics basic understanding statistics required mean median standard deviation needed extract knowledge obtain better results from data computer programming data science knowledge least one programming language required r python spark some required computer programming languages data science databases depth understanding databases sql essential data science get data work data difference between bi data science bi stands business intelligence which also used data analysis business information below some differences between bi data sciences criterion business intelligence data science data source business intelligence deals structured data e g data warehouse data science deals structured unstructured data e g weblogs feedback etc method analytical historical data scientific goes deeper know reason data report skills statistics visualization two skills required business intelligence statistics visualization machine learning required skills data science focus business intelligence focuses both past present data data science focuses past data present data also future predictions data science components main components data science given below statistics statistics one most important components data science statistics way collect analyze numerical data large amount finding meaningful insights from domain expertise data science domain expertise binds data science together domain expertise means specialized knowledge skills particular area data science various areas which we need domain experts data engineering data engineering part data science which involves acquiring storing retrieving transforming data data engineering also includes metadata data about data data visualization data visualization meant representing data visual context so people can easily understand significance data data visualization makes easy access huge amount data visuals advanced computing heavy lifting data science advanced computing advanced computing involves designing writing debugging maintaining source code computer programs mathematics mathematics critical part data science mathematics involves study quantity structure space changes data scientist knowledge good mathematics essential machine learning machine learning backbone data

required data science data analysis tools r python statistics sas jupyter r studio matlab excel rapidminer data warehousing etl sql hadoop informatica talend aws redshift data visualization tools r jupyter tableau cognos machine learning tools spark mahout azure ml studio machine learning data science become data scientist one should also aware machine learning its algorithms data science various machine learning algorithms which broadly being used following name some machine learning algorithms used data science regression decision tree clustering principal component analysis support vector machines naive bayes artificial neural network apriori we provide you some brief introduction few important algorithms here linear regression algorithm linear regression most popular machine learning algorithm based supervised learning algorithm work regression which method modeling target values based independent variables represents form linear equation which has relationship between set inputs predictive output algorithm mostly used forecasting predictions since shows linear relationship between input output variable hence called linear regression below equation can describe relationship between x y variables y mx c where y dependent variable x independent variable m slope c intercept decision tree decision tree algorithm another machine learning algorithm which belongs supervised learning algorithm one most popular machine learning algorithms can used both classification regression problems decision tree algorithm we can solve problem using tree representation which each node represents feature each branch represents decision each leaf represents outcome following example job offer problem decision tree we start from root tree compare values root attribute record attribute basis comparison we follow branch per value move next node we continue comparing values until we reach leaf node predicated class value k means clustering k means clustering one most popular algorithms machine learning which belongs unsupervised learning algorithm solves clustering problem we given data set items certain features values we need categorize those set items groups so type problems can solved using k means clustering algorithm k means clustering algorithm aims minimizing objective function which known squared error function given where j v objective function xi vj
