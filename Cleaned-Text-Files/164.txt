layers keras core layers convolutional layer pooling layers locally connected layers recurrent layers embedding layers keras merge layers deep learning library deep learning artificial neural network convolutional neural network recurrent neural network self organizing maps mega case study restricted boltzmann machine next keras tutorial keras open source high level neural network library which written python capable enough run theano tensorflow cntk developed one google engineers francois chollet made user friendly extensible modular facilitating faster experimentation deep neural networks only supports convolutional networks recurrent networks individually also combination cannot handle low level computations so makes use backend library resolve backend library act high level api wrapper low level api which lets run tensorflow cntk theano initially had over contributors during its launch which now has gone up developers has x growth ever since every year has grown big companies like microsoft google nvidia amazon have actively contributed development keras has amazing industry interaction used development popular firms likes netflix uber google expedia etc what makes keras special focus user experience has always been major part keras large adoption industry multi backend supports multi platform which helps all encoders come together coding research community present keras works amazingly production community easy grasp all concepts supports fast prototyping seamlessly runs cpu well gpu provides freedom design any architecture which later utilized api project really very simple get started easy production models actually makes keras special keras user experience keras api designed humans best practices followed keras decrease cognitive load ensures models consistent corresponding apis simple designed machines keras provides clear feedback upon occurrence any error minimizes number user actions majority common use cases easy learn use highly flexible keras provide high flexibility all its developers integrating low level deep learning languages tensorflow theano which ensures anything written base language can implemented keras how keras support claim being multi backend multi platform keras can developed r well python code can run tensorflow theano cntk mxnet per requirement keras can run cpu nvidia gpu amd gpu tpu etc ensures producing models keras really simple totally supports run tensorflow serving gpu acceleration webkeras keras js android tf tf lite ios native coreml raspberry pi keras backend keras being model level library helps developing deep learning models offering high level building blocks all low level computations products tensor convolutions etc handled keras itself rather depend specialized tensor manipulation library well optimized serve backend engine keras has managed so perfectly instead incorporating one single library tensor performing operations related particular library offers plugging different backend engines keras keras consist three backend engines which follows tensorflow tensorflow google product which one most famous deep learning tools widely used research area machine learning deep neural network came market th november under apache license built way can easily run multiple cpus gpus well mobile operating systems consists various wrappers distinct languages java c python theano theano developed university montreal quebec canada mila group open source python library widely used performing mathematical operations multi dimensional arrays incorporating scipy numpy utilizes gpus faster computation efficiently computes gradients building symbolic graphs automatically has come out very suitable unstable expressions first observes them numerically computes them more stable algorithms cntk microsoft cognitive toolkit deep learning s open source framework consists all basic building blocks which required form neural network models trained using c python incorporates c java load model making predictions advantages keras keras encompasses following advantages which follows very easy understand incorporate faster deployment network models has huge community support market most ai companies keen using supports multi backend which means you can use any one them among tensorflow cntk theano keras backend according your requirement since has easy deployment also holds support cross platform following devices which keras can deployed ios coreml android tensorflow android web browser js support cloud engine raspberry pi supports data parallelism which means keras can trained multiple gpu s instance speeding up training time processing huge amount data disadvantages keras only disadvantage keras has its own pre configured layers you want create abstract layer won t let you because cannot handle low level apis only supports high level api running top backend engine tensorflow theano cntk prerequisite keras tutorial made both beginners professionals help them understand fundamental concept keras after completion tutorial you find yourself moderate level expertise from where you can take yourself next level audience since keras deep learning s high level library so you required have hands python language well basic knowledge neural network problem we assure you you find any difficulty tutorial case you come up query
