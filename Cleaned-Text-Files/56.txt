java mcq next prev features java primary objective java programming language creation make portable simple secure programming language apart from also some excellent features which play important role popularity language features java also known java buzzwords list most important features java language given below simple object oriented portable platform independent secured robust architecture neutral interpreted high performance multithreaded distributed dynamic simple java very easy learn its syntax simple clean easy understand according sun microsystem java language simple programming language because java syntax based c so easier programmers learn after c java has removed many complicated rarely used features example explicit pointers operator overloading etc need remove unreferenced objects because automatic garbage collection java object oriented java object oriented programming language everything java object object oriented means we organize our software combination different types objects incorporate both data behavior object oriented programming oops methodology simplifies software development maintenance providing some rules basic concepts oops object class inheritance polymorphism abstraction encapsulation platform independent java platform independent because different from other languages like c c etc which compiled platform specific machines while java write once run anywhere language platform hardware software environment which program runs two types platforms software based hardware based java provides software based platform java platform differs from most other platforms sense software based platform runs top other hardware based platforms has two components runtime environment api application programming interface java code can executed multiple platforms example windows linux sun solaris mac os etc java code compiled compiler converted bytecode bytecode platform independent code because can run multiple platforms i e write once run anywhere wora secured java best known its security java we can develop virus free systems java secured because explicit pointer java programs run inside virtual machine sandbox classloader classloader java part java runtime environment jre which used load java classes java virtual machine dynamically adds security separating package classes local file system from those imported from network sources bytecode verifier checks code fragments illegal code can violate access rights objects security manager determines what resources class can access reading writing local disk java language provides securities default some security can also provided application developer explicitly through ssl jaas cryptography etc robust english mining robust strong java robust because uses strong memory management lack pointers avoids security problems java provides automatic garbage collection which runs java virtual machine get rid objects which being used java application anymore exception handling type checking mechanism java all points make java robust architecture neutral java architecture neutral because implementation dependent features example size primitive types fixed c programming int data type occupies bytes memory bit architecture bytes memory bit architecture however occupies bytes memory both bit architectures java portable java portable because facilitates you carry java bytecode any platform doesn t require any implementation high performance java faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because java bytecode close native code still little bit slower than compiled language e g c java interpreted language why slower than compiled languages e g c c etc distributed java distributed because facilitates users create distributed applications java rmi ejb used creating distributed applications feature java makes us able access files calling methods from any machine internet multi threaded thread like separate program executing concurrently we can write java programs deal many tasks once defining multiple threads main advantage multi threading doesn t occupy memory each thread shares common memory area threads important multi media web applications etc dynamic java dynamic language supports dynamic loading classes means classes loaded demand also supports functions from its native languages i e
