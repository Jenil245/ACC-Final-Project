learn devops basics provide depth knowledge various devops tools git ansible docker puppet jenkins chef nagios kubernetes what devops devops combination two words one software development second operations allows single team handle entire application lifecycle from development testing deployment operations devops helps you reduce disconnection between software developers quality assurance qa engineers system administrators devops promotes collaboration between development operations team deploy code production faster automated repeatable way devops helps increase organization speed deliver applications services also allows organizations serve customers better compete more strongly market devops can also defined sequence development operations better communication collaboration devops has become one most valuable business disciplines enterprises organizations help devops quality speed application delivery has improved great extent devops nothing practice methodology making developers operations folks work together devops represents change culture complete focus rapid service delivery through adoption agile practices context system oriented approach devops all about integration operations development process organizations have adopted devops noticed improvement software quality improvement application deployment frequency achieve hike customer satisfaction revenue hikes result successful devops implementation why devops before going further we need understand why we need devops over other methods operation development team worked complete isolation after design build testing deployment performed respectively s why consumed more time than actual build cycles without use devops team members spending large amount time designing testing deploying instead building project manual code deployment leads human errors production coding operation teams have separate timelines synch causing further delays devops history first conference named devopsdays held ghent belgium belgian consultant patrick debois founded conference state devops report launched conceived alanna brown puppet annual state devops report published nicole forsgren jez humble gene kim others found devops adoption accelerating also nicole forsgren gene kim jez humble founded dora devops research assignment nicole forsgren gene kim jez humble published accelerate building scaling high performing technology organizations devops architecture features here some key features devops architecture automation automation can reduce time consumption especially during testing deployment phase productivity increases releases made quicker automation lead catching bugs quickly so can fixed easily contiguous delivery each code defined through automated tests cloud based services builds promotes production using automated deploys collaboration development operations team collaborates devops team which improves cultural model teams become more productive productivity which strengthens accountability ownership teams share responsibilities work closely sync which turn makes deployment production faster integration applications need integrated other components environment integration phase where existing code combined new functionality tested continuous integration testing enable continuous development frequency releases micro services leads significant operational challenges overcome problems continuous integration delivery implemented deliver quicker safer reliable manner configuration management ensures application interact only those resources concerned environment which runs configuration files created where external configuration application separated from source code configuration file can written during deployment can loaded run time depending environment which running devops advantages disadvantages here some advantages disadvantages devops can have business advantages devops excellent approach quick development deployment applications responds faster market changes improve business growth devops escalate business profit decreasing software delivery time transportation costs devops clears descriptive process which gives clarity product development delivery improves customer experience satisfaction devops simplifies collaboration places all tools cloud customers access devops means collective responsibility which leads better team engagement productivity disadvantages devops professional expert s developers less available developing devops so expensive adopting new devops technology
