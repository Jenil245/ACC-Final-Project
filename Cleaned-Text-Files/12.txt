access modifier method overriding two types modifiers java access modifiers non access modifiers access modifiers java specifies accessibility scope field method constructor class we can change access level fields constructors methods class applying access modifier four types java access modifiers private access level private modifier only within class cannot accessed from outside class default access level default modifier only within package cannot accessed from outside package you do specify any access level default protected access level protected modifier within package outside package through child class you do make child class cannot accessed from outside package public access level public modifier everywhere can accessed from within class outside class within package outside package many non access modifiers static abstract synchronized native volatile transient etc here we going learn access modifiers only understanding java access modifiers let s understand access modifiers java simple table access modifier within class within package outside package subclass only outside package private y n n n default y y n n protected y y y n public y y y y private private access modifier accessible only within class simple example private access modifier example we have created two classes simple class contains private data member private method we accessing private members from outside class so compile time error class private int data private void msg system out println hello java public class simple public static void main string args obj new system out println obj data compile time error obj msg compile time error role private constructor you make any class constructor private you cannot create instance class from outside class example class private private constructor void msg system out println hello java public class simple public static void main string args obj new compile time error note class cannot private protected except nested class default you don t use any modifier treated default default default modifier accessible only within package cannot accessed from outside package provides more accessibility than private more restrictive than protected public example default access modifier example we have created two packages pack mypack we accessing class from outside its package since class public so cannot accessed from outside package save java package pack class void msg system out println hello save b java package mypack import pack class b public static void main string args obj new compile time error obj msg compile time error above example scope class its method msg default so cannot accessed from outside package protected protected access modifier accessible within package outside package through inheritance only protected access modifier can applied data member method constructor can t applied class provides more accessibility than default modifer example protected access modifier example we have created two packages pack mypack class pack package public so can accessed from outside package msg method package declared protected so can accessed from outside class only through inheritance save java package pack public class protected void msg system out println hello save b java package mypack import pack class b extends public static void main string args b obj new b obj msg output hello public public access modifier accessible everywhere has widest scope among all other modifiers example public access modifier save java package pack public class public void msg system out println hello save b java package mypack import pack class b public static void main string args obj new obj msg output hello java access modifiers method overriding you overriding any method overridden method i e declared subclass must more restrictive class protected void msg system out println hello java public class simple extends void msg system out println hello java c t error public static void main string args simple obj new simple obj msg default modifier more restrictive than protected why compile time error next topicencapsulation java prev next videos join our youtube
