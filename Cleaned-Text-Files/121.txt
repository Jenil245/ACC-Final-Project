c vs java many differences similarities between c programming language java list top differences between c java given below comparison index c java platform independent c platform dependent java platform independent mainly used c mainly used system programming java mainly used application programming widely used windows based web based enterprise mobile applications design goal c designed systems applications programming extension c programming language java designed created interpreter printing systems later extended support network computing designed easy use accessible broader audience goto c supports goto statement java doesn t support goto statement multiple inheritance c supports multiple inheritance java doesn t support multiple inheritance through class can achieved using interfaces java operator overloading c supports operator overloading java doesn t support operator overloading pointers c supports pointers you can write pointer program c java supports pointer internally however you can t write pointer program java means java has restricted pointer support java compiler interpreter c uses compiler only c compiled run using compiler which converts source code machine code so c platform dependent java uses both compiler interpreter java source code converted bytecode compilation time interpreter executes bytecode runtime produces output java interpreted why platform independent call value call reference c supports both call value call reference java supports call value only call reference java structure union c supports structures unions java doesn t support structures unions thread support c doesn t have built support threads relies third party libraries thread support java has built thread support documentation comment c doesn t support documentation comments java supports documentation comment create documentation java source code virtual keyword c supports virtual keyword so we can decide whether override function java has virtual keyword we can override all non static methods default other words non static methods virtual default unsigned right shift c doesn t support operator java supports unsigned right shift operator fills zero top negative numbers positive numbers works same like operator inheritance tree c always creates new inheritance tree java always uses single inheritance tree because all classes child object class java object class root inheritance tree java hardware c nearer hardware java so interactive hardware object oriented c object oriented language however c language single root hierarchy possible java also object oriented language however everything except fundamental types object java single root hierarchy everything gets derived from java lang object note java doesn t support default arguments like c java does support header files like c java uses import keyword include different classes methods c program example file main cpp include iostream using namespace std int main cout hello c programming return output hello c programming java program example file simple java class simple public static void main string args system out println hello java output hello
