quiz projects interview q comment forum training regex tutorial regex tutorial regex tutorial term regex stands regular expression regex regexp regular expression sequence different characters which describe particular search pattern also referred called rational expression mainly used searching manipulating text strings simple words you can easily search pattern replace them matching pattern help regular expression concept tool used almost all programming scripting languages php c c java perl javascript python ruby many others also used word processors word which helps users searching text document also used various ides pattern defined regular expression applied given string text from left right regular expression characters following different type characters regular expression metacharacters quantifier groups ranges escape characters character classes metacharacters metacharacters description example character used match expression its right start string expression match string which starts aab c apr aaaaab etc sign used match expression its left end string r expression match string which ends r aaabr ar r aannn r etc character used match any single character string except line terminator i e n b x expression match strings bax b x bar used match particular character group characters either side character left side matched right side s character ignored b expression which gives various strings each string contains either b used escape special character after sign string used match character string expression matches those strings which least one time present strings amcx mnar mnopax ab used match substring ab string expression matches those strings which ab present least one time strings abcx mnab mnopabx quantifiers quantifiers used regular expression specifying number occurrences character characters description example character specifies expression its left one more times s expression which gives s ss sss so character specifies expression its left zero one times expression which gives either ass character specifies expression its left more times br expression which gives b br brr brrr so x specifies expression its left only x times mab expression which gives following string which contains b s mabbbbb x specifies expression its left x more times xb expression which gives various strings containing least b s strings xbbb xbbbb so x y specifies expression its left least x times less than y times pr expression which provides two strings both strings follows prrrr prrrrr groups ranges groups ranges regular expression define collection characters enclosed brackets characters description example used match everything which simple bracket xy expression which matches following string axy used match particular number occurrences defined curly bracket its left string xz expression which matches following string xzzzzz used match any character from range characters defined square bracket xz atp r expression which matches following strings xzar xztr xzpr pqr matches p q r individually following strings matched expression p q r pqr xy matches p q r followed either x y following strings matched expression px qx rx py qy ry used matching non capturing group nt pple expression which matches following string apple matches character which defined square bracket suppose ab pqr expression which matches only following string ab z matches letters small case from z expression matches strings python good z matches letters upper case from z expression matches strings excellent nature za z used match string which either starts small case upper case letter expression matches strings xb pv fv cdux matches digit from expression matches strings aeiou square bracket only matches small case vowels aeiou square bracket only matches upper case vowels ab matches those digits characters which defined square bracket expression matches those strings which do contain escape characters character classes characters description s used match one white space character s used match one non white space character used match null character used match bell alarm d used match one decimal digit which means from d used match any non decimal digit n helps user match new line w used match alphanumeric za z characters w used match one non word character b used match word boundary regular expression different languages following scripting programming languages which use regular expression use regular expression java use regular expression php use regular expression python use regular expression javascript use regular expression java java regex java language regex regular expression application programming interface which used manipulating searching editing string you can use regular expression java importing java util regex api package your code following three classes which comes under java util regex package regex pattern class helps defining patterns regex matcher class helps performing match operations inputted string using patterns patternsyntaxexception class helps users indicating syntax error regular expression pattern util regex pattern class class util regex pattern compiled version regex can called compile method compile method accepts regex first argument class does provide any public constructor following different functions pattern class methods description static pattern compile string regex method used compile given regex pattern matcher matcher charsequence input method creates matcher matching pattern given string which inputted user string tostring method returns representation string string split charsequence input method splits string basis matches static boolean matches string regex charsequence input method matches regular expression against given input string util regex matcher class class used performing match operation input string calling matcher function any object pattern class does define any public constructor following different functions matcher class methods description boolean matches method checks whether regular expression matches pattern boolean find method searches occurrences regex string boolean find int start method searches occurrences regex string from starting index string group method helps finding matched subsequence int start method helps returning starting index matched subsequence int end method helps returning last index matched subsequence int groupcount method helps returning total number matched subsequence examples use regular expression java example example helps understanding dot operator java code import java util regex class reg public static void main string args system out println pattern matches r arp statement displays boolean value true because second character r both string regular exp system out println pattern matches bm abc statement displays boolean value false because third character different both string regular exp system out println pattern matches m msm statement displays boolean value true because third character m both string regular exp system out println pattern matches s amns statement displays boolean value true because first last character same both string regular exp system out println pattern matches s mas statement displays boolean value false because second character different both string regular exp test now output example following example uses different characters regular expression import java util regex class reg public static void main string args system out println system out println pattern matches z om tom statement returns false because string starts upper case letter which does match regex system out println system out println pattern matches rpq om tom statement returns false because string starts t which does match any character r p q regex system out println system out println pattern matches tt om tom statement returns true because string starts t which matches character t from regex system out println system out println pattern matches cat rat rat statement returns true because string matches second part from regular expression system out println system out println pattern matches cm bb ad bad statement returns true because string matches second part from regular expression system out println system out println pattern matches bit rabbit statement returns true because string contains bit which match regular expression system out println system out println pattern matches d abc statement returns true because string starts letter digit which does match regular expression system out println system out println pattern matches d abc statement returns true because string starts letter which matches regular expression due negation digit system out println system out println pattern matches za z za z z apz statement returns false because last character z string does match z regular expression system out println system out println pattern matches za z za z za z aaa statement returns true because all characters string matches regular expression system out println system out println pattern matches java tt poin tt javatpoint statement returns true because string ends t character which matches regular expression system out println system out println pattern matches d abcde statement returns true because string does contain any digit so follows regular expression system out println system out println pattern matches d abcde statement returns false because string contains digits so does follow regular expression test now output use regular expression php you can use regular expression regex php taking help functions pcre perl compatible regular expression library different types built functions following table which used working regular expressions functions case sensitive functions description preg match preg match function returns true regular expression matches specific string otherwise false preg match all preg match all function used matching all occurrences pattern string preg replace preg replace function matches pattern replace string preg split preg split function divides string substring using regex preg grep preg grep function used return all those elements input array which matches regular expression pattern examples use regular expression php example following example helps understanding how use character class group regular expression matching string php regexp za z d preg match regexp januaury statement matches regular expression string mathces statement executes otherwise else statment echo regular expression string same else echo regex pattern does match string above program php gives following output regular expression string same example following example helps understanding how use character php code php regexp j employeenames array clark kent john carter john rambo matches preg grep regexp employeenames statement store those names matches variables which start upper case j letter loop through matches array display matched names foreach matches match echo match br above program php gives following output john carter john rambo use regular expression python python regex you can use regular expression regex code python importing re module your script module defines various function methods which used handling regular expression following table defines various functions methods description re match re match method used return string which matched regular expression re search re search method returns object match when pattern found string text re findall re findall method used return string list containing all matches re split re split method used divide string basis matching regular expression re sub re sub method used replace matched string another string examples use regular expression python example example helps understanding how use findall method python script import re string fruits animals cars pattern d match re findall pattern string statement used store matching values basis given pattern from string print match statement displays values which stored match variable above program python regular expression gives following output fruits animals cars example example helps understanding how use split search sub methods python script import re string zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ten twenty thirty forty fifty sixty seventy eighty ninety hundred regex d splitval re split regex string statement splits string basis matching values between pattern string print splitval string nb nc pattern d statement defines regular expression matching string empty string replace s new string re sub pattern replace string statement replaces those matched characters string stored replace variable print new string statement displays new string after replacement characters text regular expression also referred regex regex d res re search regex text statement searches regular expression string res print regular expression found inside string else print regular expression found inside string above program python regular expression gives following output zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ten twenty thirty forty fifty sixty seventy eighty ninety hundred bs cs pattern found inside string use regular expression javascript you can easily use regular expression javascript code help following two string methods search method searches regular expression string also returns position where match found replace method used return string after replacement matched character string examples regular expression javascript example
