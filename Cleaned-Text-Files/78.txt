rod johnson spring framework makes easy development javaee application helpful beginners experienced persons spring framework spring lightweight framework can thought framework frameworks because provides support various frameworks struts hibernate tapestry ejb jsf etc framework broader sense can defined structure where we find solution various technical problems spring framework comprises several modules ioc aop dao context orm web mvc etc we learn modules next page let s understand ioc dependency injection first inversion control ioc dependency injection design patterns used remove dependency from programming code make code easier test maintain let s understand following code class employee address address employee address new address case dependency between employee address tight coupling inversion control scenario we do something like class employee address address employee address address address address thus ioc makes code loosely coupled case need modify code our logic moved new environment spring framework ioc container responsible inject dependency we provide metadata ioc container either xml file annotation advantage dependency injection makes code loosely coupled so easy maintain makes code easy test advantages spring framework many advantages spring framework follows predefined templates spring framework provides templates jdbc hibernate jpa etc technologies so need write too much code hides basic steps technologies let s take example jdbctemplate you don t need write code exception handling creating connection creating statement committing transaction closing connection etc you need write code executing query only thus save lot jdbc code loose coupling spring applications loosely coupled because dependency injection easy test dependency injection makes easier test application ejb struts application require server run application spring framework doesn t require server lightweight spring framework lightweight because its pojo implementation spring framework doesn t force programmer inherit any class implement any interface why said non invasive fast development dependency injection feature spring framework support various frameworks makes easy development javaee application powerful abstraction provides powerful abstraction javaee specifications jms jdbc jpa jta declarative support provides declarative support caching
