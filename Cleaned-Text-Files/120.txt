encounter lot digital images daily life however pictures can related anything programming world we can process digital images using various libraries tools article we learn about one popular tools python pillow however python provides many other useful libraries opencv python image library pil scikit image article completely focuses python pillow module pil before dive deep topic let s understand image processing what image processing image processing method analyzing manipulating digital images main goal extracting some information can used somewhere else let s make simple understand real life example example nowadays cctv cameras instated traffic light capture digital images identify vehicle s number plate check whether vehicle violated traffic rules all process related image processing introduction python pillow module built top pil python image library essential modules image processing python supported python we can use module python x versions pil supports variability images jpeg png bmp gif ppm tiff we can do anything digital images using pillow module upcoming section we learn various operations images filtering images creating thumbnail merging images cropping images blur image resizing image creating water mark many other operations installation pillow before start working python we need install pillow library our local machine we can do typing following command terminal pip install pillow pip install pil pip already installed system simply show requirement already satisfied using image module python pillow library used image class within show image image modules belong pillow package have few inbuilt functions load images create new images etc opening rotating displaying image opening image basic operation image processing we import image module from pil library load image provides image open method which takes image filename argument method returns image object we can make any modification image object which can saved image save method once image open we can perform operations resize crop draw many others let s understand following example example from pil import image open image using image module im image open r c users devansh sharma downloads car jpg show actual image im show show rotated image im im rotate im show output image after rotation explanation above code displayed original rotated image using standard jpeg display utility we run above code jupyter notebook output shown local machine image gallery attributes image module image class contains some attributes manipulate image object let s understand attributes using one one image filemname image filename function returns name image image image open beach jpg image filename output c users devansh sharma downloads car jpg image format function used get file format image file jpeg bmp png etc image image open beach jpg image format output jpeg image mode above method returns pixel format used image typing variables l rgb cmyk im image open r c users devansh sharma downloads car jpg im mode output rgb image size image size function returns tuple contains height weight image im image open r c users devansh sharma downloads car jpg im size output image width method returns width image im image open r c users devansh sharma downloads car jpg im width output image height method returns width image im image open r c users devansh sharma downloads car jpg im width output image info method returns dictionary holding data associated image im image open r c users devansh sharma downloads car jpg im info output jfif jfif version jfif unit jfif density progressive progression working images python pillow module makes very simple work images we can use pil image modle function let s see syntax syntax image open fp mode r above syntax fp file object represents file name path object file object can implement read seek tell methods mode represents file mode optional argument given default r consider following example example following example we open image jpg format first we display image save another file format from pil import image we opening image using image module img image open images cuba jpg display actual image imimg img rotate img show above code display actual rotate image degree explanation above code we have imported image module from pil library called image open function read image image open function returns image object method takes filename string path object image file object saving image image module provides save method save image file takes filename file object has been opened write let s understand following syntax syntax ndash image save fp format none params above syntax fp represents filename string path object file object format optional format override used when file object used its place filename options additional parameter image writer return value return value keyerror used when output format could determined from file name ioerror used when file may have been formed may have fractional data we sum up above syntax file saves based given filename we don t specify format based current filename extension image save dev png above example keeps file based file extension image type example code save png file our current working directory we can also obviously identify file type second parameter let s see following line image save dev gif gif creating thumbnails thumbnail images equal height width sometimes we need create thumbnail specify actual image pillow library provides thumbnail function method transforms actual image contain thumbnail version size thumbnail same given size thumbnail estimates suitable thumbnail size preserve aspect image we need call another method draft method configuring file reader finally resizing image let s see following syntax syntax image thumbnail size resample above syntax size defined size thumbnail resample optional resampling filter filter can one image nearest bilnear pil image bicubic pil image lanczos default pil image bicubic return returns none let s understand following example example from pil import image def thumbs try img image open r c users devansh sharma downloads car jpg img thumbnail img save images thumbnail jpg image image open images thumbnail jpg image show except ioerror pass thumb output explanation above code we have defined thumbs function contains try expect handle any occurrence try block we have opened image which we want modify thumbnail we have called thumbnail function image object we have passed thumbnail size somehow try block would through error jump except block where we defined ioerror exception merging images using pillow we can paste image onto another one pillow library provides merge function which takes mode tuple images parameters associates them single image let s see following syntax syntax image merge mode bands above syntax mode used output image bands order contains one single band image each band output return value returns image object let s understand following example example from pil import image image image open r c users devansh sharma downloads car jpg r g b image split image show image image merge rgb b g r image show output when we execute above code we can observe difference between original image image merge rgb bands merging two images merging two images same above first requires create image object essential image using open function one point should remembered developer both images must same size before merging them we create empty images using image new function we paste images using paste function after we save display resultant image using save show functions let s understand following example example from pil import image read two images image image open r c users devansh sharma downloads car jpg image show image image open r c users devansh sharma downloads staus jpg image show we must resize first image before merging them image image resize image size image size image size image size new image image new rgb image size image size new image paste image new image paste image image size new image show output explanation above code we have imported image module from pil library we opened two images merge them each other before perform merge operation we need make sure both images should same size we made size first image second image we used paste method merge them blur image using pillow blurring image method decreasing level noise image applying filter image most important aspect image processing pillow library offers imagefilter class contains several standard image filters section we discuss various techniques blurring images techniques mentioned below simple blur box blur gaussian blur image filter method use techniques mentioned above apply filters images simple blur simple blur blurring effect applied image specified through specific kernel let s see following syntax syntax filter imagefilter blur let s understand following example example from pil import image imagefilter open image original image image open r c users devansh sharma downloads car jpg original image show applying simple blur function blur image oriimage filter imagefilter blur blur image show output original image blurred image we have opened two standard images perform blur operation we can see difference between original image blurred image box blur box blur filter uses radius parameter directly proportional blur value syntax imagefilter boxblur radius above syntax radius represents box one direction radius means blur operation perform returns same image rradius minnus takes total pixels one pixels each direction let s understand following example example original image box blurred image gaussian blur filter works same box blur slight changes its algorithm also takes radius parameter we can generate different intensity gaussianblur image changing radius value syntax imagefilter gaussianblur radius let s understand following example example import image imagefiler module from pil import image imagefilter open image original image image open r c users devansh sharma downloads car jpg original image show applying gaussina blur function blur image original image filter imagefilter gaussianblur blur image show output original image gaussian blurred image creating watermark using pillow we all may see tiny text bottom online photos which called watermark excellent way protect images prevent misuse watermark does only protect from misuse also provide copyright our creative photos so preferred add watermark image before sharing social media kind text logo overlaid photo have small identity owner who owns rights photo python pillow library we can add watermark image very easily library provides image imagedraw imagefont module let s understand following example example import all three modules from image library from pil import image imagedraw imagefont creating image object img image open r c users devansh sharma downloads car jpg width height img size draw imagedraw draw img passing sample watermark text text javatpoint com specifyig font familiy font size font imagefont truetype arial ttf textwidth textheight draw textsize text font calculate x y coordinates text margin x width textwidth margin y height textheight margin draw watermark bottom right corner draw text x y text font font im show explanation above code we have imported image imagedraw imagefont modules from pillow library where imagedraw module enhances functionality draw d graphics image imagefont module responsible adding font functionality while writing watermark we created image object where we apply watermark image object passed draw method we wrote watermark saved text variable we can also set font family font size we have set times new roman font size we calculated x y coordinate specify text position image once we calculated coordinate we drew watermark bottom right corner apply color image pillow library provides imagecolor module contains colors several formats also has converter from css style color specifiers rgb tuples let s have look color names which supported imagecolor module first format hexadecimal color specifiers specified rgb rrggbb example ff denotes pure green second format ff hex color red value red green value green blue value its rgb blue standard color names imagecolor module most colors supported window system most web browsers imagecolor getrgb method method used convert color string rgb tuple raises valueerror exception case string cannot parsed let s see following syntax syntax pil imagecolor getrgb color above syntax color color string return value returns rgb red green blue alpha let s understand following example example importig imagecolor module from pil import imagecolor using getrgb method img imagecolor getrgb blue print img image imagecolor getrgb red print image output we can see above code getrgb method taken color name returned rgb values example import necessary image modules from pil import image imagecolor create new image get color rgb tuple img image new rgb imagecolor getrgb add e show image img show imagedraw module imagedraw module very important component pillow library we can provide some simple d graphics support image object module helps create new images provides some additional touches image creates some graphics also supports annotation text drawing shapes imagedraw module uses origin two dimension co ordinate which upper left corner image supports various fonts text annotations bitmap opentype truetype let s understand following example example from pil import image imagedraw imagefont get image img image open c convert rgba making blank image text initialized transparent text color text image new rgba img size getting font from saved library fnt imagefont truetype e pythonpillow fonts pacifico ttf d imagedraw draw text draw text half opacity d text tutorials font fnt fill draw text full opacity d text point font fnt fill out image alpha composite img text out show output image sequence pillow image sequence equivalent animation formats support python pil library fli flc gif some new formats maintained sequence formats tiff files can contain more than one frame well pil uploads image sequence like first frame loads according image sequence we can use seek tell methods move different frames let s understand following example example from pil import image img image open r c users devansh sharma downloads car jpg here skipping second frame img seek try while img seek img tell except eoferror end sequence pass output raise eoferror eoferror explanation above code we can see eoferror exception thrown when sequence ends overcome situation we can create sequence iterator class sequence iterator class class imagesequence def init self img self img img def getitem self xi try xi self img seek xi return self img except eoferror raise indexerror end sequence frame imagesequence img writing text image using pillow different from creating watermark we can write text image passing location where we want write text image we can pass multiple parameters text method let s understand following example example from pil import image imagedraw creating image object img image open r c users devansh sharma downloads car jpg d imagedraw draw img d text hello javatpoint fill img show output flip rotate image using pillow sometimes we need perform few basic operations rotating flipping image operations helpful get insight form existing image also enhance visibility image pillow library allows us flip rotate image very easily we use transpose method function from image module perform flip operation some most common methods given below flip left right used flipping image horizontally flip top bottom used flipping image vertically rotate used rotate image specifying degree let s understand example how flip image horizontally example import image module
