interview questions next prev java i o tutorial java i o input output used process input produce output java uses concept stream make i o operation fast java io package contains all classes required input output operations we can perform file handling java java i o api stream stream sequence data java stream composed bytes s called stream because like stream water continues flow java streams created us automatically all streams attached console system out standard output stream system standard input stream system err standard error stream let s see code print output error message console system out println simple message system err println error message let s see code get input from console int i system read returns ascii code st character system out println char i print character do you know how write common data multiple files using single stream only how can we access multiple files single stream how can we improve performance input output operation how many ways can we read data from keyboard what does console class how compress uncompress data file outputstream vs inputstream explanation outputstream inputstream classes given below outputstream java application uses output stream write data destination may file array peripheral device socket inputstream java application uses input stream read data from source may file array peripheral device socket let s understand working java outputstream inputstream figure given below outputstream class outputstream class abstract class superclass all classes representing output stream bytes output stream accepts output bytes sends them some sink useful methods outputstream method description public void write int throws ioexception used write byte current output stream public void write byte throws
