exception handling hierarchy exception classes types exception exception example scenarios where exception may occur exception handling java one powerful mechanism handle runtime errors so normal flow application can maintained tutorial we learn about java exceptions s types difference between checked unchecked exceptions what exception java dictionary meaning exception abnormal condition java exception event disrupts normal flow program object which thrown runtime what exception handling exception handling mechanism handle runtime errors classnotfoundexception ioexception sqlexception remoteexception etc advantage exception handling core advantage exception handling maintain normal flow application exception normally disrupts normal flow application why we need handle exceptions let s consider scenario statement statement statement statement statement exception occurs statement statement statement statement statement suppose statements java program exception occurs statement rest code executed i e statements executed however when we perform exception handling rest statements executed why we use exception handling java do you know what difference between checked unchecked exceptions what happens behind code int data why use multiple catch block any possibility when finally block executed what exception propagation what difference between throw throws keyword what rules using exception handling method overriding hierarchy java exception classes java lang throwable class root class java exception hierarchy inherited two subclasses exception error hierarchy java exception classes given below types java exceptions mainly two types exceptions checked unchecked error considered unchecked exception however according oracle three types exceptions namely checked exception unchecked exception error difference between checked unchecked exceptions checked exception classes directly inherit throwable class except runtimeexception error known checked exceptions example ioexception sqlexception etc checked exceptions checked compile time unchecked exception classes inherit runtimeexception known unchecked exceptions example arithmeticexception nullpointerexception arrayindexoutofboundsexception etc unchecked exceptions checked compile time checked runtime error error irrecoverable some example errors outofmemoryerror virtualmachineerror assertionerror etc java exception keywords java provides five keywords used handle exception following table describes each keyword description try try keyword used specify block where we should place exception code means we can t use try block alone try block must followed either catch finally catch catch block used handle exception must preceded try block which means we can t use catch block alone can followed finally block later finally finally block used execute necessary code program executed whether exception handled throw throw keyword used throw exception throws throws keyword used declare exceptions specifies may occur exception method doesn t throw exception always used method signature java exception handling example let s see example java exception handling which we using try catch statement handle exception javaexceptionexample java public class javaexceptionexample public static void main string args try code may raise exception int data catch arithmeticexception e system out println e rest code program system out println rest code test now output exception thread main java lang arithmeticexception zero rest code above example raises arithmeticexception which handled try catch block common scenarios java exceptions given some scenarios where unchecked exceptions may occur follows scenario where arithmeticexception occurs we divide any number zero occurs arithmeticexception int arithmeticexception scenario where nullpointerexception occurs we have null value any variable performing any operation variable throws nullpointerexception string s null system out println s length nullpointerexception scenario where numberformatexception occurs formatting any variable number mismatched may result numberformatexception suppose we have string variable has characters converting variable digit cause numberformatexception string s abc int i integer parseint s numberformatexception scenario where arrayindexoutofboundsexception occurs when array exceeds s size arrayindexoutofboundsexception occurs may other reasons occur arrayindexoutofboundsexception consider following statements int new int arrayindexoutofboundsexception java exceptions index java
