branching merging git branch merge merge conflict git rebase git squash collaborating git fetch git pull git push interview questions git interview next git tutorial git tutorial provides basic advanced concepts git github our git tutorial designed beginners professionals git modern widely used distributed version control system world developed manage projects high speed efficiency version control system allows us monitor work together our team members same workspace tutorial help you understand distributed version control system git via command line well github examples tutorial performed windows we can also perform same operations other operating systems like linux ubuntu macos what git git open source distributed version control system designed handle minor major projects high speed efficiency developed co ordinate work among developers version control allows us track work together our team members same workspace git foundation many services like github gitlab we can use git without using any other git services git can used privately publicly git created linus torvalds develop linux kernel also used important distributed version control tool devops git easy learn has fast performance superior other scm tools like subversion cvs perforce clearcase features git some remarkable features git follows open source git open source tool released under gpl general public license license scalable git scalable which means when number users increases git can easily handle situations distributed one git s great features distributed distributed means instead switching project another machine we can create clone entire repository also instead just having one central repository you send changes every user has own repository contains entire commit history project we do need connect remote repository change just stored our local repository necessary we can push changes remote repository security git secure uses sha secure hash function name identify objects within its repository files commits checked retrieved its checksum time checkout stores its history way id particular commits depends upon complete development history leading up commit once published one cannot make changes its old version speed git very fast so can complete all tasks while most git operations done local repository so provides huge speed also centralized version control system continually communicates server somewhere performance tests conducted mozilla showed extremely fast compared other vcss fetching version history from locally stored repository much faster than fetching from remote server core part git written c which ignores runtime overheads associated other high level languages git developed work linux kernel therefore capable enough handle large repositories effectively from beginning speed performance have been git s primary goals supports non linear development git supports seamless branching merging which helps visualizing navigating non linear development branch git represents single commit we can construct full branch structure help its parental commit branching merging branching merging great features git which makes different from other scm tools git allows creation multiple branches without affecting each other we can perform tasks like creation deletion merging branches tasks take few seconds only below some features can achieved branching we can create separate branch new module project commit delete whenever we want we can have production branch which always has what goes production can merged testing test branch we can create demo branch experiment check working we can also remove needed core benefit branching we want push something remote repository we do have push all our branches we can select few our branches all them together data assurance git data model ensures cryptographic integrity every unit our project provides unique commit id every commit through sha algorithm we can retrieve update commit commit id most centralized version control systems do provide integrity default staging area staging area also unique functionality git can considered preview our next commit moreover intermediate area where commits can formatted reviewed before completion when you make commit git takes changes staging area make them new commit we allowed add remove changes from staging area staging area can considered place where git stores changes although git doesn t have dedicated staging directory where can store some objects representing file changes blobs instead uses file called index another feature git makes apart from other scm tools possible quickly stage some our files commit them without committing other modified files our working directory maintain clean history git facilitates git rebase one most helpful features git fetches latest commits from master branch puts our code top thus maintains clean history project benefits git version control application allows us keep track all changes we make files our project every time we make changes files existing project we can push those changes repository other developers allowed pull your changes from repository continue work updates you added project files some significant benefits using git follows saves time git lightning fast technology each command takes only few seconds execute so we can save lot time compared login github account find out its features offline working one most important benefits git supports offline working we facing internet connectivity issues affect our work git we can do almost everything locally comparatively other cvs like svn limited prefer connection central repository undo mistakes one additional benefit git we can undo mistakes sometimes undo can savior option us git provides undo option almost everything track changes git facilitates some exciting features diff log status which allows us track changes so we can check status compare our files branches why git we have discussed many features benefits git demonstrate undoubtedly git leading version control system now we discuss some other points about why should we choose git git integrity git developed ensure security integrity content being version controlled uses checksum during transit tampering file system confirm information lost internally creates checksum value from contents file verifies when transmitting storing data trendy version control system git most widely used version control system has maximum projects among all version control systems due its amazing workflow features preferred choice developers everything local almost all operations git can performed locally significant reason use git we have ensure internet connectivity collaborate public projects many public projects available github we can collaborate those projects show our creativity world many developers collaborating public projects collaboration allows us stand experienced developers learn lot from them thus takes our programming skills next level impress recruiters we can impress recruiters mentioning git github our resume send your github profile link hr organization you want join show your skills influence them through your work increases chances getting hired prerequisites git programming language so you should have basic understanding windows commands only audience we have developed git
